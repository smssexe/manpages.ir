NAME
       pstore.conf, pstore.conf.d - PStore configuration file

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/systemd/pstore.conf /etc/systemd/pstore.conf.d/*

DESCRIPTION
       This file configures the behavior of systemd-pstore(8), a tool for archiving the contents of the persistent storage filesystem, pstore[1].

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. The main
       configuration file is either in /usr/lib/systemd/ or /etc/systemd/ and contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
       administrator. Local overrides can be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in /etc/ if it's shipped in /usr/) however using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main
       configuration file.

       In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in
       the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they
       reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence,
       and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who
       may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the
       main configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to
       simplify the ordering of the files. This also defined a concept of drop-in priority to allow distributions to ship drop-ins within a specific range
       lower than the range used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by users.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/,
       with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.

OPTIONS
       All options are configured in the [PStore] section:

       Storage=
	   Controls where to archive (i.e. copy) files from the pstore filesystem. One of "none", "external", and "journal". When "none", the tool exits
	   without processing files in the pstore filesystem. When "external" (the default), files are archived into /var/lib/systemd/pstore/, and logged into
	   the journal. When "journal", pstore file contents are logged only in the journal.

	   Added in version 243.

       Unlink=
	   Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after processing. Takes a boolean value. When true, a pstore file is removed from the pstore
	   once it has been archived (either to disk or into the journal). When false, processing of pstore files occurs normally, but the files remain in the
	   pstore. The default is true in order to maintain the pstore in a nearly empty state, so that the pstore has storage available for the next kernel
	   error event.

	   Added in version 243.

       The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template /etc/systemd/pstore.conf file that is installed by default.
