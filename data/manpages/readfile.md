READFILE(3am)							   GNU Awk Extension Modules							 READFILE(3am)

NAME
       readfile - return the entire contents of a file as a string

SYNOPSIS
       @load "readfile"

       result = readfile("/some/path")

       For making whole files be single records:

       @load "readfile"
       BEGIN { PROCINFO["readfile"] = 1 }

DESCRIPTION
       The readfile extension adds a single function named readfile().	The argument is the name of the file to read.  The return value is a string containing
       the entire contents of the requested file.

       Upon error, the function returns the empty string and sets ERRNO.

       In  addition, it adds an input parser that is activated if PROCINFO["readfile"] exists.	When activated, each input file is returned in its entirety as
       $0.  RT is set to the null string.

EXAMPLE
       @load "readfile"
       ...
       contents = readfile("/path/to/file");
       if (contents == "" && ERRNO != "") {
	   print("problem reading file", ERRNO) > "/dev/stderr"
	   ...
       }
