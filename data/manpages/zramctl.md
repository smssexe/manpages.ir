NAME
       zramctl - set up and control zram devices

SYNOPSIS
       Get info:
	   zramctl [options]

       Reset zram:
	   zramctl -r zramdev...

       Print name of first unused zram device:
	   zramctl -f

       Set up a zram device:
	   zramctl [-f | zramdev] [-s size] [-t number] [-a algorithm]

DESCRIPTION
       zramctl is used to quickly set up zram device parameters, to reset zram devices, and to query the status of used zram devices.

       If no option is given, all non-zero size zram devices are shown.

       Note that zramdev node specified on command line has to already exist. The command zramctl creates a new /dev/zram<N> nodes only when --find option
       specified. It’s possible (and common) that after system boot /dev/zram<N> nodes are not created yet.

OPTIONS
       -a, --algorithm lzo|lz4|lz4hc|deflate|842|zstd
	   Set the compression algorithm to be used for compressing data in the zram device.

	   The list of supported algorithms could be inaccurate as it depends on the current kernel configuration. A basic overview can be obtained by using
	   the command "cat /sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm"; however, please note that this list might also be incomplete. This is due to the fact that ZRAM
	   utilizes the Crypto API, and if certain algorithms were built as modules, it becomes impossible to enumerate all of them.

       -f, --find
	   Find the first unused zram device. If a --size argument is present, then initialize the device.

       -n, --noheadings
	   Do not print a header line in status output.

       -o, --output list
	   Define the status output columns to be used. If no output arrangement is specified, then a default set is used. Use --help to get a list of all
	   supported columns.

       --output-all
	   Output all available columns.

       --raw
	   Use the raw format for status output.

       -r, --reset
	   Reset the options of the specified zram device(s). Zram device settings can be changed only after a reset.

       -s, --size size
	   Create a zram device of the specified size. Zram devices are aligned to memory pages; when the requested size is not a multiple of the page size,
	   it will be rounded up to the next multiple. When not otherwise specified, the unit of the size parameter is bytes.

	   The size argument may be followed by the multiplicative suffixes KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the
	   "iB" is optional, e.g., "K" has the same meaning as "KiB") or the suffixes KB (=1000), MB (=1000*1000), and so on for GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB and YB.

       -t, --streams number
	   Set the maximum number of compression streams that can be used for the device. The default is use all CPUs and one stream for kernels older than
	   4.6.

       -h, --help
	   Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
	   Print version and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       zramctl returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.

FILES
       /dev/zram[0..N]
	   zram block devices

EXAMPLE
       The following commands set up a zram device with a size of one gigabyte and use it as swap device.

	    # zramctl --find --size 1024M
	    /dev/zram0
	    # mkswap /dev/zram0
	    # swapon /dev/zram0
	    ...
	    # swapoff /dev/zram0
	    # zramctl --reset /dev/zram0
