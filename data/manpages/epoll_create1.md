epoll_create(2)							      System Calls Manual						       epoll_create(2)

NAME
       epoll_create, epoll_create1 - open an epoll file descriptor

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/epoll.h>

       int epoll_create(int size);
       int epoll_create1(int flags);

DESCRIPTION
       epoll_create() creates a new epoll(7) instance.	Since Linux 2.6.8, the size argument is ignored, but must be greater than zero; see HISTORY.

       epoll_create()  returns	a file descriptor referring to the new epoll instance.	This file descriptor is used for all the subsequent calls to the epoll
       interface.  When no longer required, the file descriptor returned by epoll_create() should be closed by using close(2).	When all file descriptors  re‚Äê
       ferring to an epoll instance have been closed, the kernel destroys the instance and releases the associated resources for reuse.

   epoll_create1()
       If  flags  is  0,  then,	 other than the fact that the obsolete size argument is dropped, epoll_create1() is the same as epoll_create().	 The following
       value can be included in flags to obtain different behavior:

       EPOLL_CLOEXEC
	      Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in open(2) for reasons  why  this
	      may be useful.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, these system calls return a file descriptor (a nonnegative integer).	 On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL size is not positive.

       EINVAL (epoll_create1()) Invalid value specified in flags.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file descriptors has been reached.

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to create the kernel object.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       epoll_create()
	      Linux 2.6, glibc 2.3.2.

       epoll_create1()
	      Linux 2.6.27, glibc 2.9.

       In  the	initial epoll_create() implementation, the size argument informed the kernel of the number of file descriptors that the caller expected to add
       to the epoll instance.  The kernel used this information as a hint for the amount of space to initially allocate in internal data structures describing
       events.	(If necessary, the kernel would allocate more space if the caller's usage exceeded the hint given in size.)  Nowadays, this hint is no	longer
       required	 (the  kernel  dynamically sizes the required data structures without needing the hint), but size must still be greater than zero, in order to
       ensure backward compatibility when new epoll applications are run on older kernels.

       Prior to Linux 2.6.29, a /proc/sys/fs/epoll/max_user_instances kernel parameter limited live epolls for each real user ID, and caused epoll_create() to
       fail with EMFILE on overrun.
