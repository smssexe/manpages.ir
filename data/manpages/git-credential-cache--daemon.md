NAME
       git-credential-cache--daemon - Temporarily store user credentials in memory

SYNOPSIS
       git credential-cache--daemon [--debug] <socket-path>

DESCRIPTION
	   Note

	   You probably don’t want to invoke this command yourself; it is started automatically when you use git-credential-cache(1).

       This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by <socket-path> for git-credential-cache clients. Clients may store and retrieve credentials.
       Each credential is held for a timeout specified by the client; once no credentials are held, the daemon exits.

       If the --debug option is specified, the daemon does not close its stderr stream, and may output extra diagnostics to it even after it has begun
       listening for clients.
