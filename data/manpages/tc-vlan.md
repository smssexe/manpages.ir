NAME
       vlan - vlan manipulation module

SYNOPSIS
       tc ... action vlan { pop | pop_eth | PUSH | MODIFY | PUSH_ETH } [ CONTROL ]

       PUSH := push [ protocol VLANPROTO ]  [ priority VLANPRIO ] id VLANID

       MODIFY := modify [ protocol VLANPROTO ]	[ priority VLANPRIO ] id VLANID

       PUSH_ETH := push_eth dst_mac LLADDR src_mac LLADDR

       CONTROL := { reclassify | pipe | drop | continue | pass | goto chain CHAIN_INDEX }

DESCRIPTION
       The  vlan action allows one to perform 802.1Q en- or decapsulation on a packet, reflected by the operation modes POP, PUSH and MODIFY.  The POP mode is
       simple, as no further information is required to just drop the outer-most VLAN encapsulation. The PUSH and MODIFY modes require at least a  VLANID  and
       allow one to optionally choose the VLANPROTO to use.

       The  vlan action can also be used to add or remove the base Ethernet header. The pop_eth mode, which takes no argument, is used to remove the base Eth‚Äê
       ernet header. All existing VLANs must have been previously dropped. The opposite operation, adding a base Ethernet header, is done  with	 the  push_eth
       mode.  In  that case, the packet must have no MAC header (stacking MAC headers is not permitted). This mode is mostly useful when a previous action has
       encapsulated the whole original frame behind a network header and one needs to prepend an Ethernet header before forwarding the resulting packet.

OPTIONS
       pop    Decapsulation mode, no further arguments allowed.

       push   Encapsulation mode. Requires at least id option.

       modify Replace mode. Existing 802.1Q tag is replaced. Requires at least id option.

       pop_eth
	      Ethernet header decapsulation mode. Only works on a plain Ethernet header: VLANs, if any, must be removed first.

       push_eth
	      Ethernet header encapsulation mode. The Ethertype is automatically set using the network header type. Chaining Ethernet headers is not  allowed:
	      the packet must have no MAC header when using this mode. Requires the dst_mac and src_mac options.

       id VLANID
	      Specify  the  VLAN ID to encapsulate into.  VLANID is an unsigned 16bit integer, the format is detected automatically (e.g. prefix with '0x' for
	      hexadecimal interpretation, etc.).

       protocol VLANPROTO
	      Choose the VLAN protocol to use. At the time of writing, the kernel accepts only 802.1Q or 802.1ad.

       priority VLANPRIO
	      Choose the VLAN priority to use. Decimal number in range of 0-7.

       dst_mac LLADDR
	      Choose the destination MAC address to use.

       src_mac LLADDR
	      Choose the source MAC address to use.

       CONTROL
	      How to continue after executing this action.

	      reclassify
		     Restarts classification by jumping back to the first filter attached to this action's parent.

	      pipe   Continue with the next action, this is the default.

	      drop   Packet will be dropped without running further actions.

	      continue
		     Continue classification with next filter in line.

	      pass   Return to calling qdisc for packet processing. This ends the classification process.

EXAMPLES
       The following example encapsulates incoming ICMP packets on eth0 from 10.0.0.2 into VLAN ID 123:

	      #tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
	      #tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: pref 11 protocol ip \
		   u32 match ip protocol 1 0xff flowid 1:1 \
		       match ip src 10.0.0.2 flowid 1:1 \
		   action vlan push id 123

       Here is an example of the pop function: Incoming VLAN packets on eth0 are decapsulated and the classification process  then  restarted  for  the	 plain
       packet:

	      #tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle ffff: ingress
	      #tc filter add dev $ETH parent ffff: pref 1 protocol 802.1Q \
		   u32 match u32 0 0 flowid 1:1 \
		   action vlan pop reclassify

       For an example of the pop_eth and push_eth modes, see tc-mpls(8).
