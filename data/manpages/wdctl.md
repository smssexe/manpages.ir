NAME
       wdctl - show hardware watchdog status

SYNOPSIS
       wdctl [options] [device...]

DESCRIPTION
       Show hardware watchdog status. The default device is /dev/watchdog. If more than one device is specified then the output is separated by one blank
       line.

       If the device is already used or user has no permissions to read from the device, then wdctl reads data from sysfs. In this case information about
       supported features (flags) might be missing.

       Note that the number of supported watchdog features is hardware specific.

OPTIONS
       -f, --flags list
	   Print only the specified flags.

       -F, --noflags
	   Do not print information about flags.

       -I, --noident
	   Do not print watchdog identity information.

       -n, --noheadings
	   Do not print a header line for flags table.

       -o, --output list
	   Define the output columns to use in table of watchdog flags. If no output arrangement is specified, then a default set is used. Use --help to get
	   list of all supported columns.

       -O, --oneline
	   Print all wanted information on one line in key="value" output format.

       -p, --setpretimeout seconds
	   Set the watchdog pre-timeout in seconds. A watchdog pre-timeout is a notification generated by the watchdog before the watchdog reset might occur
	   in the event the watchdog has not been serviced. This notification is handled by the kernel and can be configured to take an action using sysfs or
	   by --setpregovernor.

       -g, --setpregovernor governor
	   Set pre-timeout governor name. For available governors see default wdctl output.

       -r, --raw
	   Use the raw output format.

       -s, --settimeout seconds
	   Set the watchdog timeout in seconds.

       -T, --notimeouts
	   Do not print watchdog timeouts.

       -x, --flags-only
	   Same as -I -T.

       -h, --help
	   Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
	   Print version and exit.
