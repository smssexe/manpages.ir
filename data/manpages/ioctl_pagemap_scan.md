NAME
       ioctl_pagemap_scan - get and/or clear page flags

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/fs.h>  /* Definition of struct pm_scan_arg,
				 struct page_region, and PAGE_IS_* constants */
       #include <sys/ioctl.h>

       int ioctl(int pagemap_fd, PAGEMAP_SCAN, struct pm_scan_arg *arg);

DESCRIPTION
       This ioctl(2) is used to get and optionally clear some specific flags from page table entries.  The information is returned with PAGE_SIZE granularity.

       To  start  tracking  the	 written  state (flag) of a page or range of memory, the UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC must be enabled by UFFDIO_API ioctl(2) on user‚Äê
       faultfd and memory range must be registered with UFFDIO_REGISTER ioctl(2) in UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_WP mode.

   Supported page flags
       The following page table entry flags are supported:

       PAGE_IS_WPALLOWED
	      The page has asynchronous write-protection enabled.

       PAGE_IS_WRITTEN
	      The page has been written to from the time it was write protected.

       PAGE_IS_FILE
	      The page is file backed.

       PAGE_IS_PRESENT
	      The page is present in the memory.

       PAGE_IS_SWAPPED
	      The page is swapped.

       PAGE_IS_PFNZERO
	      The page has zero PFN.

       PAGE_IS_HUGE
	      The page is THP or Hugetlb backed.

   Supported operations
       The get operation is always performed if the output buffer is specified.	 The other operations are as following:

       PM_SCAN_WP_MATCHING
	      Write protect the matched pages.

       PM_SCAN_CHECK_WPASYNC
	      Abort the scan when a page is found which doesn't have the Userfaultfd Asynchronous Write protection enabled.

   The struct pm_scan_arg argument
       struct pm_scan_arg {
	   __u64  size;
	   __u64  flags;
	   __u64  start;
	   __u64  end;
	   __u64  walk_end;
	   __u64  vec;
	   __u64  vec_len;
	   __u64  max_pages
	   __u64  category_inverted;
	   __u64  category_mask;
	   __u64  category_anyof_mask
	   __u64  return_mask;
       };

       size   This field should be set to the size of the structure in bytes, as in sizeof(struct pm_scan_arg).

       flags  The operations to be performed are specified in it.

       start  The starting address of the scan is specified in it.

       end    The ending address of the scan is specified in it.

       walk_end
	      The kernel returns the scan's ending address in it.  The walk_end equal to end means that scan has completed on the entire range.

       vec    The address of page_region array for output.

		  struct page_region {
		      __u64  start;
		      __u64  end;
		      __u64  categories;
		  };

       vec_len
	      The length of the page_region struct array.

       max_pages
	      It is the optional limit for the number of output pages required.

       category_inverted
	      PAGE_IS_* categories which values match if 0 instead of 1.

       category_mask
	      Skip pages for which any PAGE_IS_* category doesn't match.

       category_anyof_mask
	      Skip pages for which no PAGE_IS_* category matches.

       return_mask
	      PAGE_IS_* categories that are to be reported in page_region.

RETURN VALUE
       On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

       EINVAL Invalid arguments i.e., invalid size of the argument, invalid flags, invalid categories, the start address  isn't	 aligned  with	PAGE_SIZE,  or
	      vec_len is specified when vec is NULL.

       EFAULT Invalid arg pointer, invalid vec pointer, or invalid address range specified by start and end.

       ENOMEM No memory is available.

       EINTR  Fetal signal is pending.

STANDARDS
       Linux.
