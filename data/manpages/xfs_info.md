NAME
       xfs_info - display XFS filesystem geometry information

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_info [ -t mtab ] [ mount-point | block-device | file-image ]
       xfs_info -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_info	 displays geometry information about an existing XFS filesystem.  The mount-point argument is the pathname of a directory where the filesystem
       is mounted.  The block-device or file-image contain a raw XFS filesystem.  The existing contents of the filesystem are undisturbed.

OPTIONS
       -t     Specifies an alternate mount table file (default is /proc/mounts if it exists, else /etc/mtab).  This is	used  when  working  with  filesystems
	      mounted  without writing to /etc/mtab file - refer to mount(8) for further details.  This option has no effect with the block-device or file-im‚Äê
	      age parameters.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits. The mount-point argument is not required with -V.

EXAMPLES
       Understanding xfs_info output.

       Suppose one has the following "xfs_info /dev/sda" output:

	 meta-data=/dev/pmem0		  isize=512    agcount=8, agsize=5974144 blks
		  =			  sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
		  =			  crc=1	       finobt=1, sparse=1, rmapbt=1
		  =			  reflink=1
	 data	  =			  bsize=4096   blocks=47793152, imaxpct=25
		  =			  sunit=32     swidth=128 blks
	 naming	  =version 2		  bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0, ftype=1
	 log	  =internal log		  bsize=4096   blocks=23336, version=2
		  =			  sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
	 realtime =none			  extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0

       Here, the data section of the output indicates "bsize=4096", meaning the data block size for this filesystem is 4096 bytes.  This  section  also	 shows
       "sunit=32  swidth=128  blks",  which  means the stripe unit is 32*4096 bytes = 128 kibibytes and the stripe width is 128*4096 bytes = 512 kibibytes.  A
       single stripe of this filesystem therefore consists of four stripe units (128 blocks / 32 blocks per unit).
