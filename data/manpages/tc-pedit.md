DESCRIPTION
       The pedit action can be used to change arbitrary packet data. The location of data to change can either be specified by giving an offset and size as in
       RAW_OP, or for header values by naming the header and field to edit the size is then chosen automatically based on the header field size.

OPTIONS
       ex     Use extended pedit.  EXTENDED_LAYERED_OP and the add/decrement CMD_SPEC are allowed only in this mode.

       offset OFFSET { u32 | u16 | u8 }
	      Specify  the offset at which to change data.  OFFSET is a signed integer, it's base is automatically chosen (e.g. hex if prefixed by 0x or octal
	      if prefixed by 0).  The second argument specifies the length of data to change, that is four bytes (u32), two bytes (u16) or a single byte (u8).

       at AT offmask MASK shift SHIFT
	      This is an optional part of RAW_OP which allows one to have a variable OFFSET depending on packet data at offset AT, which is binary ANDed  with
	      MASK and right-shifted by SHIFT before adding it to OFFSET.

       eth ETHHDR_FIELD
	      Change an ETH header field. The supported keywords for ETHHDR_FIELD are:

	      src
	      dst    Source or destination MAC address in the standard format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

	      type   Ether-type in numeric value

       ip IPHDR_FIELD
	      Change an IPv4 header field. The supported keywords for IPHDR_FIELD are:

	      src
	      dst    Source or destination IP address, a four-byte value.

	      tos
	      dsfield
	      precedence
		     Type Of Service field, an eight-bit value.

	      ihl    Change the IP Header Length field, a four-bit value.

	      protocol
		     Next-layer Protocol field, an eight-bit value.

	      nofrag
	      firstfrag
	      ce
	      df
	      mf     Change  IP	 header	 flags.	 Note that the value to pass to the set command is not just a bit value, but the full byte including the flags
		     field.  Though only the relevant bits of that value are respected, the rest ignored.

       ip BEYOND_IPHDR_FIELD
	      Supported only for non-extended layered op. It is passed to the kernel as offsets relative to the beginning of the IP header and assumes the  IP
	      header is of minimum size (20 bytes). The supported keywords for BEYOND_IPHDR_FIELD are:

	      dport
	      sport  Destination or source port numbers, a 16-bit value. Indeed, IPv4 headers don't contain this information. Instead, this will set an offset
		     which suits at least TCP and UDP if the IP header is of minimum size (20 bytes). If not, this will do unexpected things.

	      icmp_type
	      icmp_code
		     Again,  this  allows  one to change data past the actual IP header itself. It assumes an ICMP header is present immediately following the
		     (minimal sized) IP header.	 If it is not or the latter is bigger than the minimum of 20 bytes, this  will	do  unexpected	things.	 These
		     fields are eight-bit values.

       ip EX_IPHDR_FIELD
	      Supported only when ex is used. The supported keywords for EX_IPHDR_FIELD are:

	      ttl

       ip6 IP6HDR_FIELD
	      The supported keywords for IP6HDR_FIELD are:

	      src
	      dst
	      traffic_class
	      flow_lbl
	      payload_len
	      nexthdr
	      hoplimit

       tcp TCPHDR_FIELD
	      The supported keywords for TCPHDR_FIELD are:

	      sport
	      dport  Source or destination TCP port number, a 16-bit value.

	      flags

       udp UDPHDR_FIELD
	      The supported keywords for UDPHDR_FIELD are:

	      sport
	      dport  Source or destination TCP port number, a 16-bit value.

       clear  Clear the addressed data (i.e., set it to zero).

       invert Swap every bit in the addressed data.

       set VAL
	      Set  the	addressed  data to a specific value. The size of VAL is defined by either one of the u32, u16 or u8 keywords in RAW_OP, or the size of
	      the addressed header field in LAYERED_OP.

       add VAL
	      Add the addressed data by a specific value. The size of VAL is defined by the size of the addressed header field in  EXTENDED_LAYERED_OP.	  This
	      operation is supported only for extended layered op.

       decrement
	      Decrease the addressed data by one.  This operation is supported only for ip ttl and ip6 hoplimit.

       preserve
	      Keep the addressed data as is.

       retain RVAL
	      This optional extra part of CMD_SPEC allows one to exclude bits from being changed. Supported only for 32 bits fields or smaller.

       CONTROL
	      The following keywords allow one to control how the tree of qdisc, classes, filters and actions is further traversed after this action.

	      reclassify
		     Restart with the first filter in the current list.

	      pipe   Continue with the next action attached to the same filter.

	      drop
	      shot   Drop the packet.

	      continue
		     Continue classification with the next filter in line.

	      pass   Finish classification process and return to calling qdisc for further packet processing. This is the default.

EXAMPLES
       Being  able  to edit packet data, one could do all kinds of things, such as e.g.	 implementing port redirection. Certainly not the most useful applica‚Äê
       tion, but as an example it should do:

       First, qdiscs need to be set up to attach filters to. For the receive path, a simple ingress qdisc will do, for transmit path a classful qdisc (HTB  in
       this case) is necessary:

	      tc qdisc replace dev eth0 root handle 1: htb
	      tc qdisc add dev eth0 ingress handle ffff:

       Finally,	 a  filter  with  pedit	 action can be added for each direction. In this case, u32 is used matching on the port number to redirect from, while
       pedit then does the actual rewriting:

	      tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: u32 \
		   match ip dport 23 0xffff \
		   action pedit pedit munge ip dport set 22
	      tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
		   match ip sport 22 0xffff \
		   action pedit pedit munge ip sport set 23
	      tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
		   match ip sport 22 0xffff \
		   action pedit ex munge ip dst set 192.168.1.199
	      tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
		   match ip sport 22 0xffff \
		   action pedit ex munge ip6 dst set fe80::dacb:8aff:fec7:320e
	      tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
		   match ip sport 22 0xffff \
		   action pedit ex munge eth dst set 11:22:33:44:55:66
	      tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
		   match ip dport 23 0xffff \
		   action pedit ex munge tcp dport set 22

       To rewrite just part of a field, use the retain directive. E.g. to overwrite the DSCP part of a dsfield with $DSCP, without touching ECN:

	      tc filter add dev eth0 ingress flower ... \
		   action pedit ex munge ip dsfield set $((DSCP << 2)) retain 0xfc

       And vice versa, to set ECN to e.g. 1 without impacting DSCP:

	      tc filter add dev eth0 ingress flower ... \
		   action pedit ex munge ip dsfield set 1 retain 0x3
