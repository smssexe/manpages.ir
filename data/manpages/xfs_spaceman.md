xfs_spaceman(8)							    System Manager's Manual						       xfs_spaceman(8)

NAME
       xfs_spaceman - show free space information about an XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_spaceman [ -c cmd ] file
       xfs_spaceman -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_spaceman reports and controls free space usage in an XFS filesystem.

OPTIONS
       -c cmd	 xfs_spaceman  commands	 may  be  run interactively (the default) or as arguments on the command line. Multiple -c arguments may be given. The
		 commands are run in the sequence given, then the program exits.

COMMANDS
       freesp [ -dgrs ] [-a agno]... [ -b | -e bsize | -h bsize | -m factor ]
	      With no arguments, freesp shows a histogram of all free space extents in the filesystem.	The command takes the following options:

		 -a agno
		     Collect free space information from this allocation group.	 This option can be specified multiple times to collect from multiple groups.

		 -b  This argument establishes that the histogram bin sizes are successive powers of two.  This is the default, and is mutually exclusive with
		     the -e, -h, and -m options.

		 -d  Print debugging information such as the raw free space extent information.

		 -g  Print the free space block and extent counts for each AG.

		 -e bsize
		     Set all histogram bin sizes to a specific value.  This option is mutually exclusive with the -b, -h, and -m options.

		 -h bsize
		     Create a histogram bin with a lower bound of this value.  The upper bound of this bin will be one less than the lower bound of  the  next
		     highest  histogram	 bin.  This option can be given multiple times to control the exact bin sizes.	This option is mutually exclusive with
		     the -b, -e, and -m options.

		 -m factor
		     Create each histogram bin with a size that is this many times the size of the prvious bin created.	 This  option  is  mutually  exclusive
		     with the -b, -e, and -h options.

		 -r  Query the realtime device for free space information.

		 -s  Display a summary of the free space information found.

       info   Displays	selected  geometry information about the filesystem.  The opened file must be a mount point of a XFS filesystem.  The output will have
	      the same format that xfs_info(8) prints when querying a filesystem.

       health [ -a agno] [ -c ] [ -f ] [ -i inum ] [ -q ] [ paths ]
	      Reports the health of the given group of filesystem metadata.
		 -a agno
		     Report on the health of the given allocation group.
		 -c  Scan all inodes in the filesystem and report each file's health status.  If the -a option is given, scan only the inodes in that AG.
		 -f  Report on the health of metadata that affect the entire filesystem.
		 -i inum
		     Report on the health of a specific inode.
		 -q  Report only unhealthy metadata.
		 paths
		     Report on the health of the files at the given path.

       help [ command ]
	      Display a brief description of one or all commands.

       prealloc [ -u id ] [ -g id ] [ -p id ] [ -m minlen ] [ -s ]
	      Removes speculative preallocation.  If no -u, -g, or -p options are given, this command acts on all files.  The command takes the following  op‐
	      tions:

		 -u uid
		     Clear all speculative preallocations for files with this user id.	This option can be given in combination with the -g  and  -p options.

		 -g gid
		     Clear all speculative preallocations for files with this group id.	 This option can be given in combination with the -u  and  -p options.

		 -p pid
		     Clear  all	 speculative  preallocations for files with this project id.  This option can be given in combination with the -u  and	-g op‐
		     tions.

		 -m minlen
		     Ignore all files smaller than this size.  Units can be supplied for this argument.

		 -s  Wait for removal to complete.

       print  Display a list of all open files.

       quit   Exit xfs_spaceman.

       trim ( -a agno | -f | offset length ) [ -m minlen ]
	      Instructs the underlying storage device to release all storage that may be backing free space in the filesystem.	The command takes the  follow‐
	      ing options: (One of -a, -f, or the offset/length pair are required.)

		 -a agno
		     Trim  free	 space	extents in the given allocation group.	This option is mutually exclusive with the -f option and the offset/length op‐
		     tions.

		 -f  Trim all free space in the filesystem.  This option is mutually exclusive with the -a option and the offset/length options.

		 option, length
		     Trim all free space within the physical range defined by the offset and length from this filesystem.  Units can be appended to these  ar‐
		     guments.  This option is mutually exclusive with the -a and -f options.

		 -m minlen
		     Do not trim free space extents shorter than this length.  Units can be appended to this argument.
