NAME
       xfs_growfs - expand an XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_growfs [ -dilnrx ] [ -D size ] [ -e rtextsize ] [ -L size ] [ -m maxpct ] [ -t mtab ] [ -R size ] [ mount-point | block-device ]

       xfs_growfs -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_growfs expands an existing XFS filesystem (see xfs(5)).  The mount-point argument is the pathname of the directory where the filesystem is mounted.
       The  block-device  argument  is	the device name of a mounted XFS filesystem.  The filesystem must be mounted to be grown (see mount(8)).  The existing
       contents of the filesystem are undisturbed, and the added space becomes available for additional file storage.

OPTIONS
       -d | -D size
	      Specifies that the data section of the filesystem should be resized. If the -D size option is given, the data section is changed to  that	 size,
	      otherwise	 the  data  section is grown to the largest size possible with the -d option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks. A filesystem
	      with only 1 AG cannot be shrunk further, and a filesystem cannot be shrunk to the point where it would only have 1 AG.

       -e     Allows the real-time extent size to be specified. In mkfs.xfs(8) this is specified with -r extsize=nnnn.

       -i     The new log is an internal log (inside the data section).	 [NOTE: This option is not implemented]

       -l | -L size
	      Specifies that the log section of the filesystem should be grown, shrunk, or moved. If the -L size option is given, the log section  is  changed
	      to be that size, if possible. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks.	 The size of an internal log must be smaller than the size of an allo‐
	      cation  group (this value is printed at mkfs(8) time). If neither -i nor -x is given with -l, the log continues to be internal or external as it
	      was before.  [NOTE: These options are not implemented]

       -m     Specify a new value for the maximum percentage of space in the filesystem that can be allocated as inodes. In mkfs.xfs(8) this is specified with
	      -i maxpct=nn.

       -n     Specifies that no change to the filesystem is to be made.	 The filesystem geometry is printed, and argument checking is performed, but no growth
	      occurs.  See output examples below.

       -r | -R size
	      Specifies that the real-time section of the filesystem should be grown. If the -R size option is given, the real-time section is grown  to  that
	      size, otherwise the real-time section is grown to the largest size possible with the -r option. The size is expressed in filesystem blocks.  The
	      filesystem does not need to have contained a real-time section before the xfs_growfs operation.

       -t     Specifies	 an  alternate	mount  table  file (default is /proc/mounts if it exists, else /etc/mtab).  This is used when working with filesystems
	      mounted without writing to /etc/mtab file - refer to mount(8) for further details.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits. The mount-point argument is not required with -V.

       xfs_growfs is most often used in conjunction with logical volumes (see md(4) and lvm(8) on Linux).  However, it can also be used on a regular disk par‐
       tition, for example if a partition has been enlarged while retaining the same starting block.

PRACTICAL USE
       Filesystems normally occupy all of the space on the device where they reside. In order to grow a filesystem, it is necessary to provide added space for
       it to occupy. Therefore there must be at least one spare new disk partition available. Adding the space is often done through the use of a logical vol‐
       ume manager.
