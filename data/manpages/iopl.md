iopl(2)								      System Calls Manual							       iopl(2)

NAME
       iopl - change I/O privilege level

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/io.h>

       [[deprecated]] int iopl(int level);

DESCRIPTION
       iopl() changes the I/O privilege level of the calling thread, as specified by the two least significant bits in level.

       The I/O privilege level for a normal thread is 0.  Permissions are inherited from parents to children.

       This  call is deprecated, is significantly slower than ioperm(2), and is only provided for older X servers which require access to all 65536 I/O ports.
       It is mostly for the i386 architecture.	On many other architectures it does not exist or will always return an error.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL level is greater than 3.

       ENOSYS This call is unimplemented.

       EPERM  The calling thread has insufficient privilege to call iopl(); the CAP_SYS_RAWIO capability is required to raise the I/O  privilege  level	 above
	      its current value.

VERSIONS
       glibc2 has a prototype both in <sys/io.h> and in <sys/perm.h>.  Avoid the latter, it is available on i386 only.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       Prior to Linux 5.5 iopl() allowed the thread to disable interrupts while running at a higher I/O privilege level.  This will probably crash the system,
       and is not recommended.

       Prior  to  Linux	 3.7,  on some architectures (such as i386), permissions were inherited by the child produced by fork(2) and were preserved across ex‚Äê
       ecve(2).	 This behavior was inadvertently changed in Linux 3.7, and won't be reinstated.
