NAME
       locale.gen - Configuration file for locale-gen

DESCRIPTION
       The file /etc/locale.gen lists the locales that are to be generated by the locale-gen command.

       Each line is of the form:

       <locale> <charset>

       where <locale> is one of the locales given in /usr/share/i18n/locales and <charset> is one of the character sets listed in /usr/share/i18n/charmaps

       The locale-gen command will generate all the locales, placing them in /usr/lib/locale.
