NAME
       docker-network-rm - Remove one or more networks

SYNOPSIS
       docker network rm NETWORK [NETWORK...]

DESCRIPTION
       Removes	one or more networks by name or identifier. To remove a network, you must first disconnect any containers connected to it.  To remove the net‚Äê
       work named 'my-network':

       $ docker network rm my-network

       To delete multiple networks in a single docker network rm command, provide multiple network names or ids. The following example deletes a network  with
       id 3695c422697f and a network named my-network:

       $ docker network rm 3695c422697f my-network

       When  you  specify  multiple networks, the command attempts to delete each in turn.  If the deletion of one network fails, the command continues to the
       next on the list and tries to delete that. The command reports success or failure for each deletion.

OPTIONS
       -f, --force[=false]	Do not error if the network does not exist

       -h, --help[=false]      help for rm
