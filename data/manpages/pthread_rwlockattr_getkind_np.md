NAME
       pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np, pthread_rwlockattr_getkind_np - set/get the read-write lock kind of the thread read-write lock attribute object

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np(pthread_rwlockattr_t *attr,
			      int pref);
       int pthread_rwlockattr_getkind_np(
			      const pthread_rwlockattr_t *restrict attr,
			      int *restrict pref);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np(), pthread_rwlockattr_getkind_np():
	   _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       The  pthread_rwlockattr_setkind_np()  function  sets the "lock kind" attribute of the read-write lock attribute object referred to by attr to the value
       specified in pref.  The argument pref may be set to one of the following:

       PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_READER_NP
	      This is the default.  A thread may hold multiple read locks; that is, read locks are recursive.  According to The Single Unix Specification, the
	      behavior is unspecified when a reader tries to place a lock, and there is no write lock but writers  are	waiting.   Giving  preference  to  the
	      reader,  as is set by PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_READER_NP, implies that the reader will receive the requested lock, even if a writer is waiting.  As
	      long as there are readers, the writer will be starved.

       PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NP
	      This is intended as the write lock analog of PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_READER_NP.  This is ignored by glibc because the POSIX requirement to support
	      recursive read locks would cause this option to create trivial deadlocks; instead use PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP which ensures
	      the application developer will not take recursive read locks thus avoiding deadlocks.

       PTHREAD_RWLOCK_PREFER_WRITER_NONRECURSIVE_NP
	      Setting the lock kind to this avoids writer starvation as long as any read locking is not done in a recursive fashion.

       The pthread_rwlockattr_getkind_np() function returns the value of the lock kind attribute of the read-write lock attribute object referred to  by  attr
       in the pointer pref.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  these  functions  return  0.   Given valid pointer arguments, pthread_rwlockattr_getkind_np() always succeeds.  On error, pthread_rwlock‚Äê
       attr_setkind_np() returns a nonzero error number.

ERRORS
       EINVAL pref specifies an unsupported value.

STANDARDS
       GNU; hence the suffix "_np" (nonportable) in the names.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.1.
