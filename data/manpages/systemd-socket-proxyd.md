NAME
       systemd-socket-proxyd - Bidirectionally proxy local sockets to another (possibly remote) socket

SYNOPSIS

       systemd-socket-proxyd [OPTIONS...] HOST:PORT

       systemd-socket-proxyd [OPTIONS...] UNIX-DOMAIN-SOCKET-PATH

DESCRIPTION
       systemd-socket-proxyd is a generic socket-activated network socket forwarder proxy daemon for IPv4, IPv6 and UNIX stream sockets. It may be used to
       bi-directionally forward traffic from a local listening socket to a local or remote destination socket.

       One use of this tool is to provide socket activation support for services that do not natively support socket activation. On behalf of the service to
       activate, the proxy inherits the socket from systemd, accepts each client connection, opens a connection to a configured server for each client, and
       then bidirectionally forwards data between the two.

       This utility's behavior is similar to socat(1). The main differences for systemd-socket-proxyd are support for socket activation with "Accept=no" and
       an event-driven design that scales better with the number of connections.

OPTIONS
       The following options are understood:

       -h, --help
	   Print a short help text and exit.

       --version
	   Print a short version string and exit.

       --connections-max=, -c
	   Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections, defaults to 256. If the limit of concurrent connections is reached further connections will be
	   refused.

	   Added in version 233.

       --exit-idle-time=
	   Sets the time before exiting when there are no connections, defaults to infinity. Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as
	   "5min 20s".

	   Added in version 246.

EXIT STATUS
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

EXAMPLES
   Simple Example
       Use two services with a dependency and no namespace isolation.

       Example 1. proxy-to-nginx.socket

	   [Socket]
	   ListenStream=80

	   [Install]
	   WantedBy=sockets.target

       Example 2. proxy-to-nginx.service

	   [Unit]
	   Requires=nginx.service
	   After=nginx.service
	   Requires=proxy-to-nginx.socket
	   After=proxy-to-nginx.socket

	   [Service]
	   Type=notify
	   ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-socket-proxyd /run/nginx/socket
	   PrivateTmp=yes
	   PrivateNetwork=yes

       Example 3. nginx.conf

	   [...]
	   server {
	       listen	    unix:/run/nginx/socket;
	       [...]

       Example 4. Enabling the proxy

	   # systemctl enable --now proxy-to-nginx.socket
	   $ curl http://localhost:80/

       If nginx.service has StopWhenUnneeded= set, then passing --exit-idle-time= to systemd-socket-proxyd allows both services to stop during idle periods.

   Namespace Example
       Similar as above, but runs the socket proxy and the main service in the same private namespace, assuming that nginx.service has PrivateTmp= and
       PrivateNetwork= set, too.

       Example 5. proxy-to-nginx.socket

	   [Socket]
	   ListenStream=80

	   [Install]
	   WantedBy=sockets.target

       Example 6. proxy-to-nginx.service

	   [Unit]
	   Requires=nginx.service
	   After=nginx.service
	   Requires=proxy-to-nginx.socket
	   After=proxy-to-nginx.socket
	   JoinsNamespaceOf=nginx.service

	   [Service]
	   Type=notify
	   ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-socket-proxyd 127.0.0.1:8080
	   PrivateTmp=yes
	   PrivateNetwork=yes

       Example 7. nginx.conf

	   [...]
	   server {
	       listen	    8080;
	       [...]

       Example 8. Enabling the proxy

	   # systemctl enable --now proxy-to-nginx.socket
	   $ curl http://localhost:80/
