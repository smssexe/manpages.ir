uselib(2)							      System Calls Manual							     uselib(2)

NAME
       uselib - load shared library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       [[deprecated]] int uselib(const char *library);

DESCRIPTION
       The  system  call  uselib()  serves  to load a shared library to be used by the calling process.	 It is given a pathname.  The address where to load is
       found in the library itself.  The library can have any recognized binary format.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       In addition to all of the error codes returned by open(2) and mmap(2), the following may also be returned:

       EACCES The library specified by library does not have read or execute permission, or the caller does not have search permission for one of the directo‚Äê
	      ries in the path prefix.	(See also path_resolution(7).)

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has been reached.

       ENOEXEC
	      The file specified by library is not an executable of a known type; for example, it does not have the correct magic numbers.

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       This obsolete system call is not supported by glibc.  No declaration is provided in glibc headers, but, through a quirk of history, glibc before	 glibc
       2.23  did  export  an ABI for this system call.	Therefore, in order to employ this system call, it was sufficient to manually declare the interface in
       your code; alternatively, you could invoke the system call using syscall(2).

       In ancient libc versions (before glibc 2.0), uselib() was used to load the shared libraries with names found in an array of names in the binary.

       Since Linux 3.15, this system call is available only when the kernel is configured with the CONFIG_USELIB option.
