NAME
       xfs_mdrestore - restores an XFS metadump image to a filesystem image

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_mdrestore [ -gi ] [ -l logdev ] source target
       xfs_mdrestore -i [ -l logdev ] source
       xfs_mdrestore -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_mdrestore  is a debugging tool that restores a metadata image generated by xfs_metadump(8) to a filesystem. The source argument specifies the loca‐
       tion of the metadump image and the target argument specifies the destination for the filesystem image.  If the source is -, then the metadata image  is
       read  from  stdin. This allows the output of be another program such as a compression application to be redirected to xfs_mdrestore.  The target can be
       either a file or a device.

       xfs_mdrestore should not be used to restore metadata onto an existing filesystem unless you are completely certain the target can be destroyed.

OPTIONS
       -g     Shows restore progress on stdout.

       -i     Shows metadump information on stdout.  If no target is specified, exits after displaying information.  Older metadumps man not include  any  de‐
	      scriptive information.

       -l logdev
	      Metadump	in  v2 format can contain metadata dumped from an external log.	 In such a scenario, the user has to provide a device to which the log
	      device contents from the metadump file are copied.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits.

DIAGNOSTICS
       xfs_mdrestore returns an exit code of 0 if all the metadata is successfully restored or 1 if an error occurs.
