NAME
       systemd.netdev - Virtual Network Device configuration

SYNOPSIS
       netdev.netdev

DESCRIPTION
       A plain ini-style text file that encodes configuration about a virtual network device, used by systemd-networkd(8). See systemd.syntax(7) for a general
       description of the syntax.

       The main Virtual Network Device file must have the extension .netdev; other extensions are ignored. Virtual network devices are created as soon as
       networkd is started. If a netdev with the specified name already exists, networkd will use that as-is rather than create its own. Note that the
       settings of the pre-existing netdev will not be changed by networkd.

       The .netdev files are read from the files located in the system network directory /usr/lib/systemd/network and /usr/local/lib/systemd/network, the
       volatile runtime network directory /run/systemd/network and the local administration network directory /etc/systemd/network. All configuration files
       are collectively sorted and processed in alphanumeric order, regardless of the directories in which they live. However, files with identical filenames
       replace each other. It is recommended that each filename is prefixed with a number smaller than "70" (e.g.  10-vlan.netdev). Otherwise, .netdev files
       generated by systemd-network-generator.service(8) may take precedence over user configured files. Files in /etc/ have the highest priority, files in
       /run/ take precedence over files with the same name in /usr/lib/. This can be used to override a system-supplied configuration file with a local file
       if needed. As a special case, an empty file (file size 0) or symlink with the same name pointing to /dev/null disables the configuration file entirely
       (it is "masked").

       Along with the netdev file foo.netdev, a "drop-in" directory foo.netdev.d/ may exist. All files with the suffix ".conf" from this directory will be
       merged in the alphanumeric order and parsed after the main file itself has been parsed. This is useful to alter or add configuration settings, without
       having to modify the main configuration file. Each drop-in file must have appropriate section headers.

       In addition to /etc/systemd/network, drop-in ".d" directories can be placed in /usr/lib/systemd/network or /run/systemd/network directories. Drop-in
       files in /etc/ take precedence over those in /run/ which in turn take precedence over those in /usr/lib/. Drop-in files under any of these directories
       take precedence over the main netdev file wherever located. (Of course, since /run/ is temporary and /usr/lib/ is for vendors, it is unlikely drop-ins
       should be used in either of those places.)

[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS
       A virtual network device is only created if the [Match] section matches the current environment, or if the section is empty. The following keys are
       accepted:

       Host=
	   Matches against the hostname or machine ID of the host. See ConditionHost= in systemd.unit(5) for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark
	   ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

	   Added in version 211.

       Virtualization=
	   Checks whether the system is executed in a virtualized environment and optionally test whether it is a specific implementation. See
	   ConditionVirtualization= in systemd.unit(5) for details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is
	   assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

	   Added in version 211.

       KernelCommandLine=
	   Checks whether a specific kernel command line option is set. See ConditionKernelCommandLine= in systemd.unit(5) for details. When prefixed with an
	   exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

	   Added in version 211.

       KernelVersion=
	   Checks whether the kernel version (as reported by uname -r) matches a certain expression. See ConditionKernelVersion= in systemd.unit(5) for
	   details. When prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is
	   cleared.

	   Added in version 237.

       Credential=
	   Checks whether the specified credential was passed to the systemd-udevd.service service. See System and Service Credentials[6] for details. When
	   prefixed with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

	   Added in version 252.

       Architecture=
	   Checks whether the system is running on a specific architecture. See ConditionArchitecture= in systemd.unit(5) for details. When prefixed with an
	   exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

	   Added in version 211.

       Firmware=
	   Checks whether the system is running on a machine with the specified firmware. See ConditionFirmware= in systemd.unit(5) for details. When prefixed
	   with an exclamation mark ("!"), the result is negated. If an empty string is assigned, the previously assigned value is cleared.

	   Added in version 249.

[NETDEV] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [NetDev] section accepts the following keys:

       Description=
	   A free-form description of the netdev.

	   Added in version 215.

       Name=
	   The interface name used when creating the netdev. This setting is compulsory.

	   Added in version 211.

       Kind=
	   The netdev kind. This setting is compulsory. See the "Supported netdev kinds" section for the valid keys.

	   Added in version 211.

       MTUBytes=
	   The maximum transmission unit in bytes to set for the device. The usual suffixes K, M, G are supported and are understood to the base of 1024. For
	   "tun" or "tap" devices, MTUBytes= setting is not currently supported in [NetDev] section. Please specify it in [Link] section of corresponding
	   systemd.network(5) files.

	   Added in version 215.

       MACAddress=
	   Specifies the MAC address to use for the device, or takes the special value "none". When "none", systemd-networkd does not request the MAC address
	   for the device, and the kernel will assign a random MAC address. For "tun", "tap", or "l2tp" devices, the MACAddress= setting in the [NetDev]
	   section is not supported and will be ignored. Please specify it in the [Link] section of the corresponding systemd.network(5) file. If this option
	   is not set, "vlan" device inherits the MAC address of the master interface. For other kind of netdevs, if this option is not set, then the MAC
	   address is generated based on the interface name and the machine-id(5).

	   Note, even if "none" is specified, systemd-udevd will assign the persistent MAC address for the device, as 99-default.link has
	   MACAddressPolicy=persistent. So, it is also necessary to create a custom .link file for the device, if the MAC address assignment is not desired.

	   Added in version 215.

[BRIDGE] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [Bridge] section only applies for netdevs of kind "bridge", and accepts the following keys:

       HelloTimeSec=
	   HelloTimeSec specifies the number of seconds between two hello packets sent out by the root bridge and the designated bridges. Hello packets are
	   used to communicate information about the topology throughout the entire bridged local area network.

	   Added in version 227.

       MaxAgeSec=
	   MaxAgeSec specifies the number of seconds of maximum message age. If the last seen (received) hello packet is more than this number of seconds old,
	   the bridge in question will start the takeover procedure in attempt to become the Root Bridge itself.

	   Added in version 227.

       ForwardDelaySec=
	   ForwardDelaySec specifies the number of seconds spent in each of the Listening and Learning states before the Forwarding state is entered.

	   Added in version 227.

       AgeingTimeSec=
	   This specifies the number of seconds a MAC Address will be kept in the forwarding database after having a packet received from this MAC Address.

	   Added in version 232.

       Priority=
	   The priority of the bridge. An integer between 0 and 65535. A lower value means higher priority. The bridge having the lowest priority will be
	   elected as root bridge.

	   Added in version 232.

       GroupForwardMask=
	   A 16-bit bitmask represented as an integer which allows forwarding of link local frames with 802.1D reserved addresses (01:80:C2:00:00:0X). A
	   logical AND is performed between the specified bitmask and the exponentiation of 2^X, the lower nibble of the last octet of the MAC address. For
	   example, a value of 8 would allow forwarding of frames addressed to 01:80:C2:00:00:03 (802.1X PAE).

	   Added in version 235.

       DefaultPVID=
	   This specifies the default port VLAN ID of a newly attached bridge port. Set this to an integer in the range 1...4094 or "none" to disable the
	   PVID.

	   Added in version 232.

       MulticastQuerier=
	   Takes a boolean. This setting controls the IFLA_BR_MCAST_QUERIER option in the kernel. If enabled, the kernel will send general ICMP queries from a
	   zero source address. This feature should allow faster convergence on startup, but it causes some multicast-aware switches to misbehave and disrupt
	   forwarding of multicast packets. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 230.

       MulticastSnooping=
	   Takes a boolean. This setting controls the IFLA_BR_MCAST_SNOOPING option in the kernel. If enabled, IGMP snooping monitors the Internet Group
	   Management Protocol (IGMP) traffic between hosts and multicast routers. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 230.

       VLANFiltering=
	   Takes a boolean. This setting controls the IFLA_BR_VLAN_FILTERING option in the kernel. If enabled, the bridge will be started in VLAN-filtering
	   mode. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 231.

       VLANProtocol=
	   Allows setting the protocol used for VLAN filtering. Takes 802.1q or, 802.1ad, and defaults to unset and kernel's default is used.

	   Added in version 246.

       STP=
	   Takes a boolean. This enables the bridge's Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 232.

       MulticastIGMPVersion=
	   Allows changing bridge's multicast Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) version. Takes an integer 2 or 3. When unset, the kernel's default
	   will be used.

	   Added in version 243.

[VLAN] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [VLAN] section only applies for netdevs of kind "vlan", and accepts the following key:

       Id=
	   The VLAN ID to use. An integer in the range 0...4094. This setting is compulsory.

	   Added in version 211.

       Protocol=
	   Allows setting the protocol used for the VLAN interface. Takes "802.1q" or, "802.1ad", and defaults to unset and kernel's default is used.

	   Added in version 248.

       GVRP=
	   Takes a boolean. The Generic VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP) is a protocol that allows automatic learning of VLANs on a network. When unset, the
	   kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 234.

       MVRP=
	   Takes a boolean. Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP) formerly known as GARP VLAN Registration Protocol (GVRP) is a standards-based Layer 2
	   network protocol, for automatic configuration of VLAN information on switches. It was defined in the 802.1ak amendment to 802.1Q-2005. When unset,
	   the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 234.

       LooseBinding=
	   Takes a boolean. The VLAN loose binding mode, in which only the operational state is passed from the parent to the associated VLANs, but the VLAN
	   device state is not changed. When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 234.

       ReorderHeader=
	   Takes a boolean. When enabled, the VLAN reorder header is used and VLAN interfaces behave like physical interfaces. When unset, the kernel's
	   default will be used.

	   Added in version 234.

       EgressQOSMaps=, IngressQOSMaps=
	   Defines a mapping of Linux internal packet priority (SO_PRIORITY) to VLAN header PCP field for outgoing and incoming frames, respectively. Takes a
	   whitespace-separated list of integer pairs, where each integer must be in the range 1...4294967294, in the format "from"-"to", e.g., "21-7 45-5".
	   Note that "from" must be greater than or equal to "to". When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 248.

[MACVLAN] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [MACVLAN] section only applies for netdevs of kind "macvlan", and accepts the following key:

       Mode=
	   The MACVLAN mode to use. The supported options are "private", "vepa", "bridge", "passthru", and "source".

	   Added in version 211.

       SourceMACAddress=
	   A whitespace-separated list of remote hardware addresses allowed on the MACVLAN. This option only has an effect in source mode. Use full colon-,
	   hyphen- or dot-delimited hexadecimal. This option may appear more than once, in which case the lists are merged. If the empty string is assigned to
	   this option, the list of hardware addresses defined prior to this is reset. Defaults to unset.

	   Added in version 246.

       BroadcastMulticastQueueLength=
	   Specifies the length of the receive queue for broadcast/multicast packets. An unsigned integer in the range 0...4294967294. Defaults to unset.

	   Added in version 248.

	   Added in version 215.

       PacketInfo=
	   Takes a boolean. Configures whether packets should be prepended with four extra bytes (two flag bytes and two protocol bytes). If disabled, it
	   indicates that the packets will be pure IP packets. Defaults to "no".

	   Added in version 215.

       VNetHeader=
	   Takes a boolean. Configures IFF_VNET_HDR flag for a tun or tap device. It allows sending and receiving larger Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO)
	   packets. This may increase throughput significantly. Defaults to "no".

	   Added in version 223.

       User=
	   User to grant access to the /dev/net/tun device.

	   Added in version 215.

       Group=
	   Group to grant access to the /dev/net/tun device.

	   Added in version 215.

       KeepCarrier=
	   Takes a boolean. If enabled, to make the interface maintain its carrier status, the file descriptor of the interface is kept open. This may be
	   useful to keep the interface in running state, for example while the backing process is temporarily shutdown. Defaults to "no".

	   Added in version 252.

[TAP] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [Tap] section only applies for netdevs of kind "tap", and accepts the same keys as the [Tun] section.

[WIREGUARD] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [WireGuard] section accepts the following keys:

       PrivateKey=
	   The Base64 encoded private key for the interface. It can be generated using the wg genkey command (see wg(8)). This option or PrivateKeyFile= is
	   mandatory to use WireGuard. Note that because this information is secret, you may want to set the permissions of the .netdev file to be owned by
	   "root:systemd-network" with a "0640" file mode.

	   Added in version 237.

       PrivateKeyFile=
	   Takes an absolute path to a file which contains the Base64 encoded private key for the interface. When this option is specified, then PrivateKey=
	   is ignored. Note that the file must be readable by the user "systemd-network", so it should be, e.g., owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640"
	   file mode. If the path refers to an AF_UNIX stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it and the key read from it.

	   Added in version 242.

       ListenPort=
	   Sets UDP port for listening. Takes either value between 1 and 65535 or "auto". If "auto" is specified, the port is automatically generated based on
	   interface name. Defaults to "auto".

	   Added in version 237.

       FirewallMark=
	   Sets a firewall mark on outgoing WireGuard packets from this interface. Takes a number between 1 and 4294967295.

	   Added in version 243.

       RouteTable=
	   The table identifier for the routes to the addresses specified in the AllowedIPs=. Takes a negative boolean value, one of the predefined names
	   "default", "main", and "local", names defined in RouteTable= in networkd.conf(5), or a number in the range 1...4294967295. When "off" the routes to
	   the addresses specified in the AllowedIPs= setting will not be configured. Defaults to false. This setting will be ignored when the same setting is
	   specified in the [WireGuardPeer] section.

	   Added in version 250.

       RouteMetric=
	   The priority of the routes to the addresses specified in the AllowedIPs=. Takes an integer in the range 0...4294967295. Defaults to 0 for IPv4
	   addresses, and 1024 for IPv6 addresses. This setting will be ignored when the same setting is specified in the [WireGuardPeer] section.

	   Added in version 250.

[WIREGUARDPEER] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [WireGuardPeer] section accepts the following keys:

       PublicKey=
	   Sets a Base64 encoded public key calculated by wg pubkey (see wg(8)) from a private key, and usually transmitted out of band to the author of the
	   configuration file. This option is mandatory for this section.

	   Added in version 237.

       PresharedKey=
	   Optional preshared key for the interface. It can be generated by the wg genpsk command. This option adds an additional layer of symmetric-key
	   cryptography to be mixed into the already existing public-key cryptography, for post-quantum resistance. Note that because this information is
	   secret, you may want to set the permissions of the .netdev file to be owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640" file mode.

	   Added in version 237.

       PresharedKeyFile=
	   Takes an absolute path to a file which contains the Base64 encoded preshared key for the peer. When this option is specified, then PresharedKey= is
	   ignored. Note that the file must be readable by the user "systemd-network", so it should be, e.g., owned by "root:systemd-network" with a "0640"
	   file mode. If the path refers to an AF_UNIX stream socket in the file system a connection is made to it and the key read from it.

	   Added in version 242.

       AllowedIPs=
	   Sets a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses with CIDR masks from which this peer is allowed to send incoming traffic and to which
	   outgoing traffic for this peer is directed. This setting can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all previous
	   assignments are cleared.

	   The catch-all 0.0.0.0/0 may be specified for matching all IPv4 addresses, and ::/0 may be specified for matching all IPv6 addresses.

	   Note that this only affects routing inside the network interface itself, i.e. the packets that pass through the tunnel itself. To cause packets to
	   be sent via the tunnel in the first place, an appropriate route needs to be added as well — either in the "[Routes]" section on the ".network"
	   matching the wireguard interface, or externally to systemd-networkd.

	   Added in version 237.

       Endpoint=
	   Sets an endpoint IP address or hostname, followed by a colon, and then a port number. IPv6 address must be in the square brackets. For example,
	   "111.222.333.444:51820" for IPv4 and "[1111:2222::3333]:51820" for IPv6 address. This endpoint will be updated automatically once to the most
	   recent source IP address and port of correctly authenticated packets from the peer at configuration time.

	   Added in version 237.

       PersistentKeepalive=
	   Sets a seconds interval, between 1 and 65535 inclusive, of how often to send an authenticated empty packet to the peer for the purpose of keeping a
	   stateful firewall or NAT mapping valid persistently. For example, if the interface very rarely sends traffic, but it might at anytime receive
	   traffic from a peer, and it is behind NAT, the interface might benefit from having a persistent keepalive interval of 25 seconds. If set to 0 or
	   "off", this option is disabled. By default or when unspecified, this option is off. Most users will not need this.

	   Added in version 237.

       RouteTable=
	   The table identifier for the routes to the addresses specified in the AllowedIPs=. Takes a negative boolean value, one of the predefined names
	   "default", "main", and "local", names defined in RouteTable= in networkd.conf(5), or a number in the range 1...4294967295. Defaults to unset, and
	   the value specified in the same setting in the [WireGuard] section will be used.

	   Added in version 250.

       RouteMetric=
	   The priority of the routes to the addresses specified in the AllowedIPs=. Takes an integer in the range 0...4294967295. Defaults to unset, and the
	   value specified in the same setting in the [WireGuard] section will be used.

	   Added in version 250.

[BOND] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [Bond] section accepts the following key:

       Mode=
	   Specifies one of the bonding policies. The default is "balance-rr" (round robin). Possible values are "balance-rr", "active-backup", "balance-xor",
	   "broadcast", "802.3ad", "balance-tlb", and "balance-alb".

	   Added in version 216.

       TransmitHashPolicy=
	   Selects the transmit hash policy to use for slave selection in balance-xor, 802.3ad, and tlb modes. Possible values are "layer2", "layer3+4",
	   "layer2+3", "encap2+3", and "encap3+4".

	   Added in version 216.

       LACPTransmitRate=
	   Specifies the rate with which link partner transmits Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Unit packets in 802.3ad mode. Possible values are
	   "slow", which requests partner to transmit LACPDUs every 30 seconds, and "fast", which requests partner to transmit LACPDUs every second. The
	   default value is "slow".

	   Added in version 216.

       MIIMonitorSec=
	   Specifies the frequency that Media Independent Interface link monitoring will occur. A value of zero disables MII link monitoring. This value is
	   rounded down to the nearest millisecond. The default value is 0.

	   Added in version 216.

       UpDelaySec=
	   Specifies the delay before a link is enabled after a link up status has been detected. This value is rounded down to a multiple of MIIMonitorSec=.
	   The default value is 0.

	   Added in version 216.

       DownDelaySec=
	   Specifies the delay before a link is disabled after a link down status has been detected. This value is rounded down to a multiple of
	   MIIMonitorSec=. The default value is 0.

	   Added in version 216.

       LearnPacketIntervalSec=
	   Specifies the number of seconds between instances where the bonding driver sends learning packets to each slave peer switch. The valid range is
	   1...0x7fffffff; the default value is 1. This option has an effect only for the balance-tlb and balance-alb modes.

	   Added in version 220.

       AdSelect=
	   Specifies the 802.3ad aggregation selection logic to use. Possible values are "stable", "bandwidth" and "count".

	   Added in version 220.

       AdActorSystemPriority=
	   Specifies the 802.3ad actor system priority. Takes a number in the range 1...65535.

	   Added in version 240.

       AdUserPortKey=
	   Specifies the 802.3ad user defined portion of the port key. Takes a number in the range 0...1023.

	   Added in version 240.

       AdActorSystem=
	   Specifies the 802.3ad system MAC address. This cannot be a null or multicast address.

	   Added in version 240.

       FailOverMACPolicy=
	   Specifies whether the active-backup mode should set all slaves to the same MAC address at the time of enslavement or, when enabled, to perform
	   special handling of the bond's MAC address in accordance with the selected policy. The default policy is none. Possible values are "none", "active"
	   and "follow".

	   Added in version 220.

       ARPValidate=
	   Specifies whether or not ARP probes and replies should be validated in any mode that supports ARP monitoring, or whether non-ARP traffic should be
	   filtered (disregarded) for link monitoring purposes. Possible values are "none", "active", "backup" and "all".

	   Added in version 220.

       ARPIntervalSec=
	   Specifies the ARP link monitoring frequency. A value of 0 disables ARP monitoring. The default value is 0, and the default unit seconds.

	   Added in version 220.

       ARPIPTargets=
	   Specifies the IP addresses to use as ARP monitoring peers when ARPIntervalSec= is greater than 0. These are the targets of the ARP request sent to
	   determine the health of the link to the targets. Specify these values in IPv4 dotted decimal format. At least one IP address must be given for ARP
	   monitoring to function. The maximum number of targets that can be specified is 16. The default value is no IP addresses.

	   Added in version 220.

       ARPAllTargets=
	   Specifies the quantity of ARPIPTargets= that must be reachable in order for the ARP monitor to consider a slave as being up. This option affects
	   only active-backup mode for slaves with ARPValidate enabled. Possible values are "any" and "all".

	   Added in version 220.

       PrimaryReselectPolicy=
	   Specifies the reselection policy for the primary slave. This affects how the primary slave is chosen to become the active slave when failure of the
	   active slave or recovery of the primary slave occurs. This option is designed to prevent flip-flopping between the primary slave and other slaves.
	   Possible values are "always", "better" and "failure".

	   Added in version 220.

       ResendIGMP=
	   Specifies the number of IGMP membership reports to be issued after a failover event. One membership report is issued immediately after the
	   failover, subsequent packets are sent in each 200ms interval. The valid range is 0...255. Defaults to 1. A value of 0 prevents the IGMP membership
	   report from being issued in response to the failover event.

	   Added in version 220.

       PacketsPerSlave=
	   Specify the number of packets to transmit through a slave before moving to the next one. When set to 0, then a slave is chosen at random. The valid
	   range is 0...65535. Defaults to 1. This option only has effect when in balance-rr mode.

	   Added in version 220.

       GratuitousARP=
	   Specify the number of peer notifications (gratuitous ARPs and unsolicited IPv6 Neighbor Advertisements) to be issued after a failover event. As
	   soon as the link is up on the new slave, a peer notification is sent on the bonding device and each VLAN sub-device. This is repeated at each link
	   monitor interval (ARPIntervalSec or MIIMonitorSec, whichever is active) if the number is greater than 1. The valid range is 0...255. The default
	   value is 1. These options affect only the active-backup mode.

	   Added in version 220.

       AllSlavesActive=
	   Takes a boolean. Specifies that duplicate frames (received on inactive ports) should be dropped when false, or delivered when true. Normally,
	   bonding will drop duplicate frames (received on inactive ports), which is desirable for most users. But there are some times it is nice to allow
	   duplicate frames to be delivered. The default value is false (drop duplicate frames received on inactive ports).

	   Added in version 220.

       DynamicTransmitLoadBalancing=
	   Takes a boolean. Specifies if dynamic shuffling of flows is enabled. Applies only for balance-tlb mode. Defaults to unset.

	   Added in version 240.

       MinLinks=
	   Specifies the minimum number of links that must be active before asserting carrier. The default value is 0.

	   Added in version 220.

       For more detail information see Linux Ethernet Bonding Driver HOWTO[1]

[XFRM] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [Xfrm] section accepts the following keys:

       InterfaceId=
	   Sets the ID/key of the xfrm interface which needs to be associated with a SA/policy. Can be decimal or hexadecimal, valid range is 1-0xffffffff.
	   This is mandatory.

	   Added in version 243.

       Independent=
	   Takes a boolean. If false (the default), the xfrm interface must have an underlying device which can be used for hardware offloading.

	   Added in version 243.

       For more detail information see Virtual XFRM Interfaces[18].

[VRF] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [VRF] section only applies for netdevs of kind "vrf" and accepts the following key:

       Table=
	   The numeric routing table identifier. This setting is compulsory.

	   Added in version 243.

[BATMANADVANCED] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [BatmanAdvanced] section only applies for netdevs of kind "batadv" and accepts the following keys:

       GatewayMode=
	   Takes one of "off", "server", or "client". A batman-adv node can either run in server mode (sharing its internet connection with the mesh) or in
	   client mode (searching for the most suitable internet connection in the mesh) or having the gateway support turned off entirely (which is the
	   default setting).

	   Added in version 248.

       Aggregation=
	   Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables aggregation of originator messages. Defaults to true.

	   Added in version 248.

       BridgeLoopAvoidance=
	   Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables avoidance of loops on bridges. Defaults to true.

	   Added in version 248.

       DistributedArpTable=
	   Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables the distributed ARP table. Defaults to true.

	   Added in version 248.

       Fragmentation=
	   Takes a boolean value. Enables or disables fragmentation. Defaults to true.

	   Added in version 248.

       HopPenalty=
	   The hop penalty setting allows one to modify batctl(8) preference for multihop routes vs. short routes. This integer value is applied to the TQ
	   (Transmit Quality) of each forwarded OGM (Originator Message), thereby propagating the cost of an extra hop (the packet has to be received and
	   retransmitted which costs airtime). A higher hop penalty will make it more unlikely that other nodes will choose this node as intermediate hop
	   towards any given destination. The default hop penalty of '15' is a reasonable value for most setups and probably does not need to be changed.
	   However, mobile nodes could choose a value of 255 (maximum value) to avoid being chosen as a router by other nodes. The minimum value is 0.

	   Added in version 248.

       OriginatorIntervalSec=
	   The value specifies the interval in seconds, unless another time unit is specified in which batman-adv floods the network with its protocol
	   information. See systemd.time(7) for more information.

	   Added in version 248.

       GatewayBandwidthDown=
	   If the node is a server, this parameter is used to inform other nodes in the network about this node's internet connection download bandwidth in
	   bits per second. Just enter any number suffixed with K, M, G or T (base 1000) and the batman-adv module will propagate the entered value in the
	   mesh.

	   Added in version 248.

       GatewayBandwidthUp=
	   If the node is a server, this parameter is used to inform other nodes in the network about this node's internet connection upload bandwidth in bits
	   per second. Just enter any number suffixed with K, M, G or T (base 1000) and the batman-adv module will propagate the entered value in the mesh.

	   Added in version 248.

       RoutingAlgorithm=
	   This can be either "batman-v" or "batman-iv" and describes which routing_algo of batctl(8) to use. The algorithm cannot be changed after interface
	   creation. Defaults to "batman-v".

	   Added in version 248.

[IPOIB] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [IPoIB] section only applies for netdevs of kind "ipoib" and accepts the following keys:

       PartitionKey=
	   Takes an integer in the range 1...0xffff, except for 0x8000. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.

	   Added in version 250.

       Mode=
	   Takes one of the special values "datagram" or "connected". Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.

	   When "datagram", the Infiniband unreliable datagram (UD) transport is used, and so the interface MTU is equal to the IB L2 MTU minus the IPoIB
	   encapsulation header (4 bytes). For example, in a typical IB fabric with a 2K MTU, the IPoIB MTU will be 2048 - 4 = 2044 bytes.

	   When "connected", the Infiniband reliable connected (RC) transport is used. Connected mode takes advantage of the connected nature of the IB
	   transport and allows an MTU up to the maximal IP packet size of 64K, which reduces the number of IP packets needed for handling large UDP
	   datagrams, TCP segments, etc and increases the performance for large messages.

	   Added in version 250.

       IgnoreUserspaceMulticastGroup=
	   Takes an boolean value. When true, the kernel ignores multicast groups handled by userspace. Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default is used.

	   Added in version 250.

[WLAN] SECTION OPTIONS
       The [WLAN] section only applies to WLAN interfaces, and accepts the following keys:

       PhysicalDevice=
	   Specifies the name or index of the physical WLAN device (e.g.  "0" or "phy0"). The list of the physical WLAN devices that exist on the host can be
	   obtained by iw phy command. This option is mandatory.

	   Added in version 251.

       Type=
	   Specifies the type of the interface. Takes one of the "ad-hoc", "station", "ap", "ap-vlan", "wds", "monitor", "mesh-point", "p2p-client", "p2p-go",
	   "p2p-device", "ocb", and "nan". This option is mandatory.

	   Added in version 251.

       WDS=
	   Enables the Wireless Distribution System (WDS) mode on the interface. The mode is also known as the "4 address mode". Takes a boolean value.
	   Defaults to unset, and the kernel's default will be used.

	   Added in version 251.
