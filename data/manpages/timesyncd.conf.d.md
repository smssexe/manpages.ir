NAME
       timesyncd.conf, timesyncd.conf.d - Network Time Synchronization configuration files

SYNOPSIS
       /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf

       /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf

       /run/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf

       /usr/lib/systemd/timesyncd.conf.d/*.conf

DESCRIPTION
       These configuration files control NTP network time synchronization. See systemd.syntax(7) for a general description of the syntax.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from those defaults. The main
       configuration file is either in /usr/lib/systemd/ or /etc/systemd/ and contains commented out entries showing the defaults as a guide to the
       administrator. Local overrides can be created by creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in /etc/ if it's shipped in /usr/) however using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over modifications to the main
       configuration file.

       In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in
       the *.conf.d/ configuration subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they
       reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence,
       and for options which accept a list of values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the local administrator, who
       may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the
       main configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to
       simplify the ordering of the files. This also defined a concept of drop-in priority to allow distributions to ship drop-ins within a specific range
       lower than the range used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by users.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the configuration directory in /etc/,
       with the same filename as the vendor configuration file.

OPTIONS
       The following settings are configured in the [Time] section:

       NTP=
	   A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses. During runtime this list is combined with any per-interface NTP servers acquired
	   from systemd-networkd.service(8).  systemd-timesyncd will contact all configured system or per-interface servers in turn, until one responds. When
	   the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and all prior assignments will have no effect. This setting defaults to an empty
	   list.

	   Added in version 216.

       FallbackNTP=
	   A space-separated list of NTP server host names or IP addresses to be used as the fallback NTP servers. Any per-interface NTP servers obtained from
	   systemd-networkd.service(8) take precedence over this setting, as do any servers set via NTP= above. This setting is hence only relevant if no
	   other NTP server information is known. When the empty string is assigned, the list of NTP servers is reset, and all prior assignments will have no
	   effect. If this option is not given, a compiled-in list of NTP servers is used.

	   Added in version 216.

       RootDistanceMaxSec=
	   Maximum acceptable root distance, i.e. the maximum estimated time required for a packet to travel to the server we are connected to from the server
	   with the reference clock. If the current server does not satisfy this limit, systemd-timesyncd will switch to a different server.

	   Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see systemd.time(5). Defaults to 5 seconds.

	   Added in version 236.

       PollIntervalMinSec=, PollIntervalMaxSec=
	   The minimum and maximum poll intervals for NTP messages. Polling starts at the minimum poll interval, and is adjusted within the specified limits
	   in response to received packets.

	   Each setting takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see systemd.time(5).  PollIntervalMinSec=
	   defaults to 32 seconds and must not be smaller than 16 seconds.  PollIntervalMaxSec= defaults to 34 min 8 s (2048 seconds) and must be larger than
	   PollIntervalMinSec=.

	   Added in version 236.

       ConnectionRetrySec=
	   Specifies the minimum delay before subsequent attempts to contact a new NTP server are made.

	   Takes a time span value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see systemd.time(5). Defaults to 30 seconds and must not be
	   smaller than 1 second.

	   Added in version 248.

       SaveIntervalSec=
	   The interval at which the current time is periodically saved to disk, in the absence of any recent synchronisation from an NTP server. This is
	   especially useful for offline systems with no local RTC, as it will guarantee that the system clock remains roughly monotonic across reboots.

	   Takes a time interval value. The default unit is seconds, but other units may be specified, see systemd.time(5). Defaults to 60 seconds.

	   Added in version 250.
