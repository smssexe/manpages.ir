SYNOPSIS
       gio-querymodules DIRECTORY…

DESCRIPTION
       gio-querymodules	 creates  a  giomodule.cache file in the listed directories. This file lists the implemented extension points for each module that has
       been found. It is used by GIO at runtime to avoid opening all modules just to find out which extension points they are implementing.

       GIO modules are usually installed in the gio/modules subdirectory of libdir.
