DESCRIPTION
       gresource  offers  a  simple commandline interface to GResource. It lets you list and extract resources that have been compiled into a resource file or
       included in an ELF file (a binary or a shared library).

       The file to operate on is specified by the FILE argument.

       If an ELF file includes multiple sections with resources, it is possible to select which one to operate on with the --section option. Use the  sections
       command to find available sections.
