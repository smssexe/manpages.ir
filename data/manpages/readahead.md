readahead(2)							      System Calls Manual							  readahead(2)

NAME
       readahead - initiate file readahead into page cache

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE	       /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
       #include <fcntl.h>

       ssize_t readahead(int fd, off_t offset, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       readahead() initiates readahead on a file so that subsequent reads from that file will be satisfied from the cache, and not block on disk I/O (assuming
       the readahead was initiated early enough and that other activity on the system did not in the meantime flush pages from the cache).

       The  fd argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which is to be read.	The offset argument specifies the starting point from which data is to
       be read and count specifies the number of bytes to be read.  I/O is performed in whole pages, so that offset is effectively  rounded  down  to  a  page
       boundary	 and  bytes  are  read	up to the next page boundary greater than or equal to (offset+count).  readahead() does not read beyond the end of the
       file.  The file offset of the open file description referred to by the file descriptor fd is left unchanged.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, readahead() returns 0; on failure, -1 is returned, with errno set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EINVAL fd does not refer to a file type to which readahead() can be applied.

VERSIONS
       On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for this system call differs, for the reasons described in syscall(2).

STANDARDS
       Linux.

HISTORY
       Linux 2.4.13, glibc 2.3.

NOTES
       _FILE_OFFSET_BITS should be defined to be 64 in code that uses a pointer to readahead, if the code is intended to be portable to traditional 32-bit x86
       and ARM platforms where off_t's width defaults to 32 bits.

BUGS
       readahead() attempts to schedule the reads in the background and return immediately.  However, it may block while  it  reads  the  filesystem  metadata
       needed  to  locate  the requested blocks.  This occurs frequently with ext[234] on large files using indirect blocks instead of extents, giving the ap‚Äê
       pearance that the call blocks until the requested data has been read.
