NAME
       pthread_mutex_consistent - make a robust mutex consistent

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       int pthread_mutex_consistent(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_mutex_consistent():
	   _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       This  function makes a robust mutex consistent if it is in an inconsistent state.  A mutex can be left in an inconsistent state if its owner terminates
       while holding the mutex, in which case the next owner who acquires the mutex will succeed and be notified by a return value of EOWNERDEAD from  a  call
       to pthread_mutex_lock().

RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_mutex_consistent() returns 0.  Otherwise, it returns a positive error number to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The mutex is either not robust or is not in an inconsistent state.

STANDARDS
       POSIX.1-2008.

HISTORY
       glibc 2.12.  POSIX.1-2008.

       Before the addition of pthread_mutex_consistent() to POSIX, glibc defined the following equivalent nonstandard function if _GNU_SOURCE was defined:

       [[deprecated]]
       int pthread_mutex_consistent_np(const pthread_mutex_t *mutex);

       This  GNU-specific  API,	 which	first appeared in glibc 2.4, is nowadays obsolete and should not be used in new programs; since glibc 2.34 it has been
       marked as deprecated.

NOTES
       pthread_mutex_consistent() simply informs the implementation that the state (shared data) guarded by the mutex has been restored to a consistent	 state
       and  that  normal  operations  can now be performed with the mutex.  It is the application's responsibility to ensure that the shared data has been re‚Äê
       stored to a consistent state before calling pthread_mutex_consistent().

       See pthread_mutexattr_setrobust(3).
