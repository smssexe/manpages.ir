NAME
       openssl-gendsa - generate a DSA private key from a set of parameters

SYNOPSIS
       openssl gendsa [-help] [-out filename] [-passout arg] [-aes128] [-aes192] [-aes256] [-aria128] [-aria192] [-aria256] [-camellia128] [-camellia192]
       [-camellia256] [-des] [-des3] [-idea] [-verbose] [-rand files] [-writerand file] [-engine id] [-provider name] [-provider-path path] [-propquery propq]
       [paramfile]

DESCRIPTION
       This command generates a DSA private key from a DSA parameter file (which will be typically generated by the openssl-dsaparam(1) command).

OPTIONS
       -help
	   Print out a usage message.

       -out filename
	   Output the key to the specified file. If this argument is not specified then standard output is used.

       -passout arg
	   The passphrase used for the output file.  See openssl-passphrase-options(1).

       -aes128, -aes192, -aes256, -aria128, -aria192, -aria256, -camellia128, -camellia192, -camellia256, -des, -des3, -idea
	   These  options  encrypt  the	 private  key  with specified cipher before outputting it. A pass phrase is prompted for.  If none of these options is
	   specified no encryption is used.

	   Note that all options must be given before the paramfile argument.  Otherwise they are ignored.

       -verbose
	   Print extra details about the operations being performed.

       -rand files, -writerand file
	   See "Random State Options" in openssl(1) for details.

       -engine id
	   See "Engine Options" in openssl(1).	This option is deprecated.

       paramfile
	   The DSA parameter file to use. The parameters in this file determine the size of the private key. DSA parameters  can  be  generated	 and  examined
	   using the openssl-dsaparam(1) command.

       -provider name
       -provider-path path
       -propquery propq
	   See "Provider Options" in openssl(1), provider(7), and property(7).

NOTES
       DSA key generation is little more than random number generation so it is much quicker that RSA key generation for example.

HISTORY
       The -engine option was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
