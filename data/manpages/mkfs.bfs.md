NAME
       mkfs.bfs - make an SCO bfs filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       mkfs.bfs [options] device [block-count]

DESCRIPTION
       mkfs.bfs creates an SCO bfs filesystem on a block device (usually a disk partition or a file accessed via the loop device).

       The block-count parameter is the desired size of the filesystem, in blocks. If nothing is specified, the entire partition will be used.

OPTIONS
       -N, --inodes number
	   Specify the desired number of inodes (at most 512). If nothing is specified, some default number in the range 48-512 is picked depending on the
	   size of the partition.

       -V, --vname label
	   Specify the volume label. I have no idea if/where this is used.

       -F, --fname name
	   Specify the filesystem name. I have no idea if/where this is used.

       --lock[=mode]
	   Use exclusive BSD lock for device or file it operates. The optional argument mode can be yes, no (or 1 and 0) or nonblock. If the mode argument is
	   omitted, it defaults to yes. This option overwrites environment variable $LOCK_BLOCK_DEVICE. The default is not to use any lock at all, but itâ€™s
	   recommended to avoid collisions with systemd-udevd(8) or other tools.

       -v, --verbose
	   Explain what is being done.

       -c
	   This option is silently ignored.

       -l
	   This option is silently ignored.

       -h, --help
	   Display help text and exit.

       -V, --version
	   Print version and exit. Option -V only works as --version when it is the only option.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status returned by mkfs.bfs is 0 when all went well, and 1 when something went wrong.
