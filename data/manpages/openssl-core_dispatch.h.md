NAME
       openssl/core_dispatch.h - OpenSSL provider dispatch numbers and function types

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/core_dispatch.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <openssl/core_dispatch.h> header defines all the operation numbers, dispatch numbers and provider interface function types currently available.

       The operation and dispatch numbers are represented with macros, which are named as follows:

       operation numbers
	   These macros have the form "OSSL_OP_opname".

       dipatch numbers
	   These macros have the form "OSSL_FUNC_opname_funcname", where "opname" is the same as in the macro for the operation this function belongs to.

       With every dispatch number, there is an associated function type.

       For further information, please see the provider(7)
