DESCRIPTION
       tmpfiles.d configuration files provide a generic mechanism to define the creation of regular files, directories, pipes, and device nodes, adjustments
       to their access mode, ownership, attributes, quota assignments, and contents, and finally their time-based removal. It is mostly commonly used for
       volatile and temporary files and directories (such as those located under /run/, /tmp/, /var/tmp/, the API file systems such as /sys/ or /proc/, as
       well as some other directories below /var/).

       systemd-tmpfiles(8) uses this configuration to create volatile files and directories during boot and to do periodic cleanup afterwards. See systemd-
       tmpfiles(8) for the description of systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service, systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service, and associated units.

       System daemons frequently require private runtime directories below /run/ to store communication sockets and similar. For these, it is better to use
       RuntimeDirectory= in their unit files (see systemd.exec(5) for details), if the flexibility provided by tmpfiles.d is not required. The advantages are
       that the configuration required by the unit is centralized in one place, and that the lifetime of the directory is tied to the lifetime of the service
       itself. Similarly, StateDirectory=, CacheDirectory=, LogsDirectory=, and ConfigurationDirectory= should be used to create directories under /var/lib/,
       /var/cache/, /var/log/, and /etc/.  tmpfiles.d should be used for files whose lifetime is independent of any service or requires more complicated
       configuration.

CONFIGURATION DIRECTORIES AND PRECEDENCE
       Each configuration file shall be named in the style of package.conf or package-part.conf. The second variant should be used when it is desirable to
       make it easy to override just this part of configuration.

       Files in /etc/tmpfiles.d override files with the same name in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d and /run/tmpfiles.d. Files in /run/tmpfiles.d override files with the
       same name in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d. Packages should install their configuration files in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d. Files in /etc/tmpfiles.d are reserved for
       the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files installed by vendor packages. All configuration files are sorted by
       their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of which of the directories they reside in. If multiple files specify the same path, the entry in the
       file with the lexicographically earliest name will be applied (note that lines suppressed due to the "!"	 are filtered before application, meaning that
       if an early line carries the exclamation mark and is suppressed because of that, a later line matching in path will be applied). All other conflicting
       entries will be logged as errors. When two lines are prefix path and suffix path of each other, then the prefix line is always created first, the
       suffix later (and if removal applies to the line, the order is reversed: the suffix is removed first, the prefix later). Lines that take globs are
       applied after those accepting no globs. If multiple operations shall be applied on the same file (such as ACL, xattr, file attribute adjustments),
       these are always done in the same fixed order. Except for those cases, the files/directories are processed in the order they are listed.

       If the administrator wants to disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in
       /etc/tmpfiles.d/ bearing the same filename.

CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT
       The configuration format is one line per path, containing type, path, mode, ownership, age, and argument fields. The lines are separated by newlines,
       the fields by whitespace:

	   #Type Path	     Mode User Group Age Argument...
	   d	 /run/user   0755 root root  10d -
	   L	 /tmp/foobar -	  -    -     -	 /dev/null

       Fields may contain C-style escapes. With the exception of the seventh field (the "argument") all fields may be enclosed in quotes. Note that any
       whitespace found in the line after the beginning of the argument field will be considered part of the argument field. To begin the argument field with
       a whitespace character, use C-style escapes (e.g.  "\x20").

   Type
       The type consists of a single letter and optionally one or more modifier characters: a plus sign ("+"), exclamation mark ("!"), minus sign ("-"),
       equals sign ("="), tilde character ("~") and/or caret ("^").

       The following line types are understood:

       f, f+
	   f will create a file if it does not exist yet. If the argument parameter is given and the file did not exist yet, it will be written to the file.
	   f+ will create or truncate the file. If the argument parameter is given, it will be written to the file. Does not follow symlinks.

       w, w+
	   Write the argument parameter to a file, if the file exists. If suffixed with +, the line will be appended to the file. If your configuration writes
	   multiple lines to the same file, use w+. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names. The argument parameter will be
	   written without a trailing newline. C-style backslash escapes are interpreted. Follows symlinks.

       d
	   Create a directory. The mode and ownership will be adjusted if specified. Contents of this directory are subject to time-based cleanup if the age
	   argument is specified.

       D
	   Similar to d, but in addition the contents of the directory will be removed when --remove is used.

       e
	   Adjust the mode and ownership of existing directories and remove their contents based on age. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place
	   of normal path names. Contents of the directories are subject to time-based cleanup if the age argument is specified. If the age argument is "0",
	   contents will be unconditionally deleted every time systemd-tmpfiles(8) --clean is run.

	   For this entry to be useful, at least one of the mode, user, group, or age arguments must be specified, since otherwise this entry has no effect.
	   As an exception, an entry with no effect may be useful when combined with !, see the examples.

	   Added in version 230.

       v
	   Create a subvolume if the path does not exist yet, the file system supports subvolumes (btrfs), and the system itself is installed into a subvolume
	   (specifically: the root directory / is itself a subvolume). Otherwise, create a normal directory, in the same way as d.

	   A subvolume created with this line type is not assigned to any higher-level quota group. For that, use q or Q, which allow creating simple quota
	   group hierarchies, see below.

	   Added in version 219.

       q
	   Create a subvolume or directory the same as v, but assign the subvolume to the same higher-level quota groups as the parent. This ensures that
	   higher-level limits and accounting applied to the parent subvolume also include the specified subvolume. On non-btrfs file systems, this line type
	   is identical to d.

	   If the subvolume already exists, no change to the quota hierarchy is made, regardless of whether the subvolume is already attached to a quota group
	   or not. Also see Q below. See btrfs-qgroup(8) for details about the btrfs quota group concept.

	   Added in version 228.

       Q
	   Create the subvolume or directory the same as v, but assign the new subvolume to a new leaf quota group. Instead of copying the higher-level quota
	   group assignments from the parent as is done with q, the lowest quota group of the parent subvolume is determined that is not the leaf quota group.
	   Then, an "intermediary" quota group is inserted that is one level below this level, and shares the same ID part as the specified subvolume. If no
	   higher-level quota group exists for the parent subvolume, a new quota group at level 255 sharing the same ID as the specified subvolume is inserted
	   instead. This new intermediary quota group is then assigned to the parent subvolume's higher-level quota groups, and the specified subvolume's leaf
	   quota group is assigned to it.

	   Effectively, this has a similar effect as q, however introduces a new higher-level quota group for the specified subvolume that may be used to
	   enforce limits and accounting to the specified subvolume and children subvolume created within it. Thus, by creating subvolumes only via q and Q, a
	   concept of "subtree quotas" is implemented. Each subvolume for which Q is set will get a "subtree" quota group created, and all child subvolumes
	   created within it will be assigned to it. Each subvolume for which q is set will not get such a "subtree" quota group, but it is ensured that they
	   are added to the same "subtree" quota group as their immediate parents.

	   It is recommended to use Q for subvolumes that typically contain further subvolumes, and where it is desirable to have accounting and quota limits
	   on all child subvolumes together. Examples for Q are typically /home/ or /var/lib/machines/. In contrast, q should be used for subvolumes that
	   either usually do not include further subvolumes or where no accounting and quota limits are needed that apply to all child subvolumes together.
	   Examples for q are typically /var/ or /var/tmp/.

	   As with q, Q has no effect on the quota group hierarchy if the subvolume already exists, regardless of whether the subvolume already belong to a
	   quota group or not.

	   Added in version 228.

       p, p+
	   Create a named pipe (FIFO) if it does not exist yet. If suffixed with + and a file already exists where the pipe is to be created, it will be
	   removed and be replaced by the pipe.

       L, L+
	   Create a symlink if it does not exist yet. If suffixed with + and a file or directory already exists where the symlink is to be created, it will be
	   removed and be replaced by the symlink. If the argument is omitted, symlinks to files with the same name residing in the directory
	   /usr/share/factory/ are created. Note that permissions and ownership on symlinks are ignored.

       c, c+
	   Create a character device node if it does not exist yet. If suffixed with + and a file already exists where the device node is to be created, it
	   will be removed and be replaced by the device node. It is recommended to suffix this entry with an exclamation mark to only create static device
	   nodes at boot, as udev will not manage static device nodes that are created at runtime.

       b, b+
	   Create a block device node if it does not exist yet. If suffixed with + and a file already exists where the device node is to be created, it will
	   be removed and be replaced by the device node. It is recommended to suffix this entry with an exclamation mark to only create static device nodes
	   at boot, as udev will not manage static device nodes that are created at runtime.

       C, C+
	   Recursively copy a file or directory, if the destination files or directories do not exist yet or the destination directory is empty. Note that
	   this command will not descend into subdirectories if the destination directory already exists and is not empty, unless the action is suffixed with
	   +. Instead, the entire copy operation is skipped. If the argument is omitted, files from the source directory /usr/share/factory/ with the same
	   name are copied. Does not follow symlinks. Contents of the directories are subject to time-based cleanup if the age argument is specified.

	   Added in version 214.

       x
	   Ignore a path during cleaning. Use this type to exclude paths from clean-up as controlled with the Age parameter. Note that lines of this type do
	   not influence the effect of r or R lines. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names.

       X
	   Ignore a path during cleaning. Use this type to exclude paths from clean-up as controlled with the Age parameter. Unlike x, this parameter will not
	   exclude the content if path is a directory, but only directory itself. Note that lines of this type do not influence the effect of r or R lines.
	   Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names.

	   Added in version 198.

       r
	   Remove a file or directory if it exists. This may not be used to remove non-empty directories, use R for that. Lines of this type accept
	   shell-style globs in place of normal path names. Does not follow symlinks.

       R
	   Recursively remove a path and all its subdirectories (if it is a directory). Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path
	   names. Does not follow symlinks.

       z
	   Adjust the access mode, user and group ownership, and restore the SELinux security context of a file or directory, if it exists. Lines of this type
	   accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names. Does not follow symlinks.

       Z
	   Recursively set the access mode, user and group ownership, and restore the SELinux security context of a file or directory if it exists, as well as
	   of its subdirectories and the files contained therein (if applicable). Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names.
	   Does not follow symlinks.

       t
	   Set extended attributes, see attr(5) for details. The argument field should take one or more assignment expressions in the form
	   namespace.attribute=value, for examples see below. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names. This can be useful
	   for setting SMACK labels. Does not follow symlinks.

	   Please note that extended attributes settable with this line type are a different concept from the Linux file attributes settable with h/H, see
	   below.

	   Added in version 218.

       T
	   Same as t, but operates recursively.

	   Added in version 219.

       h
	   Set Linux file/directory attributes. Lines of this type accept shell-style globs in place of normal path names.

	   The format of the argument field is [+-=][aAcCdDeijPsStTu]. The prefix + (the default one) causes the attributes to be added; - causes the
	   attributes to be removed; = causes the attributes to be set exactly as the following letters. The letters "aAcCdDeijPsStTu" select the new
	   attributes for the files, see chattr(1) for further information.

	   Passing only = as argument resets all the file attributes listed above. It has to be pointed out that the = prefix limits itself to the attributes
	   corresponding to the letters listed here. All other attributes will be left untouched. Does not follow symlinks.

	   Please note that the Linux file attributes settable with this line type are a different concept from the extended attributes settable with t/T, see
	   above.

       H
	   Sames as h, but operates recursively.

	   Added in version 220.

       a, a+
	   Set POSIX ACLs (access control lists), see acl(5). Additionally, if 'X' is used, the execute bit is set only if the file is a directory or already
	   has execute permission for some user, as mentioned in setfacl(1). If suffixed with +, the specified entries will be added to the existing set.
	   systemd-tmpfiles(8) will automatically add the required base entries for user and group based on the access mode of the file, unless base entries
	   already exist or are explicitly specified. The mask will be added if not specified explicitly or already present. Lines of this type accept
	   shell-style globs in place of normal path names. This can be useful for allowing additional access to certain files. Does not follow symlinks.

	   Added in version 219.

       A, A+
	   Same as a and a+, but recursive. Does not follow symlinks.

	   Added in version 219.

   Type Modifiers
       If the exclamation mark ("!") is used, this line is only safe to execute during boot, and can break a running system. Lines without the exclamation
       mark are presumed to be safe to execute at any time, e.g. on package upgrades.  systemd-tmpfiles(8) will take lines with an exclamation mark only into
       consideration, if the --boot option is given.

       For example:

	   # Make sure these are created by default so that nobody else can
	   d /tmp/.X11-unix 1777 root root 10d

	   # Unlink the X11 lock files
	   r! /tmp/.X[0-9]*-lock

       The second line in contrast to the first one would break a running system, and will only be executed with --boot.

       If the minus sign ("-") is used, this line failing to run successfully during create (and only create) will not cause the execution of systemd-tmpfiles
       to return an error.

       For example:

	   # Modify sysfs but don't fail if we are in a container with a read-only /proc
	   w- /proc/sys/vm/swappiness - - - - 10

       If the equals sign ("=") is used, the file types of existing objects in the specified path are checked, and removed if they do not match. This includes
       any implicitly created parent directories (which can be either directories or directory symlinks). For example, if there is a FIFO in place of one of
       the parent path components it will be replaced with a directory.

       If the tilde character ("~") is used, the argument (i.e. 6th) column is Base64 decoded[1] before use. This modifier is only supported on line types
       that can write file contents, i.e.  f, f+, w, +. This is useful for writing arbitrary binary data (including newlines and NUL bytes) to files. Note
       that if this switch is used, the argument is not subject to specifier expansion, neither before nor after Base64 decoding.

       If the caret character ("^") is used, the argument (i.e. 6th) column takes a service credential name to read the argument data from. See System and
       Service Credentials[2] for details about the credentials concept. This modifier is only supported on line types that can write file contents, i.e.  f,
       f+, w, w+. This is useful for writing arbitrary files with contents sourced from elsewhere, including from VM or container managers further up. If the
       specified credential is not set for the systemd-tmpfiles service, the line is silently skipped. If "^" and "~" are combined Base64 decoding is applied
       to the credential contents.

       Note that for all line types that result in creation of any kind of file node (i.e.  f/F, d/D/v/q/Q, p, L, c/b and C) leading directories are
       implicitly created if needed, owned by root with an access mode of 0755. In order to create them with different modes or ownership make sure to add
       appropriate d lines.

   Path
       The file system path specification supports simple specifier expansion, see below. The path (after expansion) must be absolute.

   Mode
       The file access mode to use when creating this file or directory. If omitted or when set to "-", the default is used: 0755 for directories, 0644 for
       all other file objects. For z, Z lines, if omitted or when set to "-", the file access mode will not be modified. This parameter is ignored for x, r,
       R, L, t, and a lines.

       Optionally, if prefixed with "~", the access mode is masked based on the already set access bits for existing file or directories: if the existing file
       has all executable bits unset, all executable bits are removed from the new access mode, too. Similarly, if all read bits are removed from the old
       access mode, they will be removed from the new access mode too, and if all write bits are removed, they will be removed from the new access mode too.
       In addition, the sticky/SUID/SGID bit is removed unless applied to a directory. This functionality is particularly useful in conjunction with Z.

       By default the access mode of listed inodes is set to the specified mode regardless if it is created anew, or already existed. Optionally, if prefixed
       with ":", the configured access mode is only applied when creating new inodes, and if the inode the line refers to already exists, its access mode is
       left in place unmodified.

   User, Group
       The user and group to use for this file or directory. This may either be a numeric ID or a user/group name. If omitted or when set to "-", the user and
       group of the user who invokes systemd-tmpfiles(8) is used. For z and Z lines, when omitted or when set to "-", the file ownership will not be modified.
       These parameters are ignored for x, r, R, L, t, and a lines.

       This field should generally only reference system users/groups, i.e. users/groups that are guaranteed to be resolvable during early boot. If this field
       references users/groups that only become resolveable during later boot (i.e. after NIS, LDAP or a similar networked directory service become
       available), execution of the operations declared by the line will likely fail. Also see Notes on Resolvability of User and Group Names[3] for more
       information on requirements on system user/group definitions.

       By default the ownership of listed inodes is set to the specified user/group regardless if it is created anew, or already existed. Optionally, if
       prefixed with ":", the configured user/group information is only applied when creating new inodes, and if the inode the line refers to already exists,
       its user/group is left in place unmodified.

   Age
       The date field, when set, is used to decide what files to delete when cleaning. If a file or directory is older than the current time minus the age
       field, it is deleted. The field format is a series of integers each followed by one of the following suffixes for the respective time units: s, m or
       min, h, d, w, ms, and us, meaning seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, milliseconds, and microseconds, respectively. Full names of the time units can
       be used too.

       If multiple integers and units are specified, the time values are summed. If an integer is given without a unit, s is assumed.

       When the age is set to zero, the files are cleaned unconditionally.

       The age field only applies to lines starting with d, D, e, v, q, Q, C, x and X. If omitted or set to "-", no automatic clean-up is done.

       If the age field starts with a tilde character "~", clean-up is only applied to files and directories one level inside the directory specified, but not
       the files and directories immediately inside it.

       The age of a file system entry is determined from its last modification timestamp (mtime), its last access timestamp (atime), and (except for
       directories) its last status change timestamp (ctime). By default, any of these three (or two) values will prevent cleanup if it is more recent than
       the current time minus the age field. To restrict the deletion based on particular type of file timestamps, the age-by argument can be used.

       The age-by argument overrides the timestamp types to be used for the age check. It can be specified by prefixing the age argument with a sequence of
       characters to specify the timestamp types and a colon (":"): "age-by...:cleanup-age". The argument can consist of a (A for directories), b (B for
       directories), c (C for directories), or m (M for directories). Those respectively indicate access, creation, last status change, and last modification
       time of a file system entry. The lower-case letter signifies that the given timestamp type should be considered for files, while the upper-case letter
       signifies that the given timestamp type should be considered for directories. See statx(2) file timestamp fields for more details about timestamp
       types.

       If not specified, the age-by field defaults to abcmABM, i.e. by default all file timestamps are taken into consideration, with the exception of the
       last status change timestamp (ctime) for directories. This is because the aging logic itself will alter the ctime whenever it deletes a file inside it.
       To ensure that running the aging logic does not feed back into the next iteration of itself, ctime for directories is ignored by default.

       For example:

	   # Files created and modified, and directories accessed more than
	   # an hour ago in "/tmp/foo/bar", are subject to time-based cleanup.
	   d /tmp/foo/bar - - - bmA:1h -

       Note that while the aging algorithm is run an exclusive BSD file lock (see flock(2)) is taken on each directory/file the algorithm decides to remove.
       If the aging algorithm finds a lock (shared or exclusive) is already taken on some directory/file, it (and everything below it) is skipped.
       Applications may use this to temporarily exclude certain directory subtrees from the aging algorithm: the applications can take a BSD file lock
       themselves, and as long as they keep it aging of the directory/file and everything below it is disabled.

       This behavior can be used to ensure guaranteed cleanup of files or directories whose lifetime should be aligned with the process that created them by
       having that process create them in a location monitored by systemd-tmpfiles with an age of "0", and having the process immediately lock the directory
       or file before using it. Because the BSD lock is process specific, the file is guaranteed to be unlocked as soon as the process exits, meaning that
       even if the process crashes, those files and directories will be unlocked and cleaned up by systemd-tmpfiles.

   Argument
       For L lines determines the destination path of the symlink. For c and b, determines the major/minor of the device node, with major and minor formatted
       as integers, separated by ":", e.g.  "1:3". For f, F, and w, the argument may be used to specify a short string that is written to the file, suffixed
       by a newline. For C, specifies the source file or directory. For t and T, determines extended attributes to be set. For a and A, determines ACL
       attributes to be set. For h and H, determines the file attributes to set. Ignored for all other lines.

       This field can contain specifiers, see below.

SPECIFIERS
       Specifiers can be used in the "path" and "argument" fields. An unknown or unresolvable specifier is treated as invalid configuration. The following

EXAMPLES
       Example 1. Create directories with specific mode and ownership

       screen(1), needs two directories created at boot with specific modes and ownership:

	   # /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/screen.conf
	   d /run/screens  1777 root screen 10d
	   d /run/uscreens 0755 root screen 10d12h

       Contents of /run/screens and /run/uscreens will be cleaned up after 10 and 10½ days, respectively.

       Example 2. Create a directory with a SMACK attribute

	   D /run/cups - - - -
	   t /run/cups - - - - security.SMACK64=printing user.attr-with-spaces="foo bar"

       The directory will be owned by root and have default mode. Its contents are not subject to time-based cleanup, but will be obliterated when
       systemd-tmpfiles --remove runs.

       Example 3. Create a directory and prevent its contents from cleanup

       abrt(1), needs a directory created at boot with specific mode and ownership and its content should be preserved from the automatic cleanup applied to
       the contents of /var/tmp:

	   # /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf
	   d /var/tmp 1777 root root 30d

	   # /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/abrt.conf
	   d /var/tmp/abrt 0755 abrt abrt -

       Example 4. Apply clean up during boot and based on time

	   # /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/dnf.conf
	   r! /var/cache/dnf/*/*/download_lock.pid
	   r! /var/cache/dnf/*/*/metadata_lock.pid
	   r! /var/lib/dnf/rpmdb_lock.pid
	   e  /var/cache/dnf/ - - - 30d

       The lock files will be removed during boot. Any files and directories in /var/cache/dnf/ will be removed after they have not been accessed in 30 days.

       Example 5. Empty the contents of a cache directory on boot

	   # /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/krb5rcache.conf
	   e! /var/cache/krb5rcache - - - 0

       Any files and subdirectories in /var/cache/krb5rcache/ will be removed on boot. The directory will not be created.

       Example 6. Provision SSH public key access for root user via Credentials in QEMU

	   -smbios type=11,value=io.systemd.credential.binary:tmpfiles.extra=$(echo "f~ /root/.ssh/authorized_keys 700 root root - $(ssh-add -L | base64 -w 0)" | base64 -w 0)

       By passing this line to QEMU, the public key of the current user will be encoded in base64, added to a tmpfiles.d line that tells systemd-tmpfiles to
       decode it into /root/.ssh/authorized_keys, encode that line itself in base64 and pass it as a Credential that will be picked up by systemd from SMBIOS
       on boot.

/RUN/ AND /VAR/RUN/
       /var/run/ is a deprecated symlink to /run/, and applications should use the latter.  systemd-tmpfiles will warn if /var/run/ is used.
