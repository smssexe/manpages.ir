setresuid(2)							      System Calls Manual							  setresuid(2)

NAME
       setresuid, setresgid - set real, effective, and saved user or group ID

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE	   /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setresuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid, uid_t suid);
       int setresgid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid, gid_t sgid);

DESCRIPTION
       setresuid() sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the calling process.

       An unprivileged process may change its real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, each to one of: the current real UID, the current effective UID,
       or the current saved set-user-ID.

       A privileged process (on Linux, one having the CAP_SETUID capability) may set its real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID to arbitrary values.

       If one of the arguments equals -1, the corresponding value is not changed.

       Regardless  of  what  changes are made to the real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, the filesystem UID is always set to the same value as the
       (possibly new) effective UID.

       Completely analogously, setresgid() sets the real GID, effective GID, and saved set-group-ID of the calling process (and always modifies the filesystem
       GID to be the same as the effective GID), with the same restrictions for unprivileged processes.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.

       Note: there are cases where setresuid() can fail even when the caller is UID 0; it is a grave security error to omit checking for a failure return from
       setresuid().

ERRORS
       EAGAIN The call would change the caller's real UID (i.e., ruid does not match the caller's real UID), but there was a temporary failure allocating  the
	      necessary kernel data structures.

       EAGAIN ruid does not match the caller's real UID and this call would bring the number of processes belonging to the real user ID ruid over the caller's
	      RLIMIT_NPROC  resource  limit.  Since Linux 3.1, this error case no longer occurs (but robust applications should check for this error); see the
	      description of EAGAIN in execve(2).

       EINVAL One or more of the target user or group IDs is not valid in this user namespace.

       EPERM  The calling process is not privileged (did not have the necessary capability in its user namespace) and tried to change the IDs to  values  that
	      are not permitted.  For setresuid(), the necessary capability is CAP_SETUID; for setresgid(), it is CAP_SETGID.

VERSIONS
   C library/kernel differences
       At  the	kernel level, user IDs and group IDs are a per-thread attribute.  However, POSIX requires that all threads in a process share the same creden‚Äê
       tials.  The NPTL threading implementation handles the POSIX requirements by providing wrapper functions	for  the  various  system  calls  that	change
       process	UIDs  and GIDs.	 These wrapper functions (including those for setresuid() and setresgid()) employ a signal-based technique to ensure that when
       one thread changes credentials, all of the other threads in the process also change their credentials.  For details, see nptl(7).

STANDARDS
       None.

HISTORY
       Linux 2.1.44, glibc 2.3.2.  HP-UX, FreeBSD.

       The original Linux setresuid() and setresgid() system calls supported only 16-bit user and group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added setresuid32()  and
       setresgid32(),  supporting  32-bit  IDs.	  The glibc setresuid() and setresgid() wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel
       versions.
