ORDCHR(3am)							   GNU Awk Extension Modules							   ORDCHR(3am)

NAME
       ordchr - convert characters to strings and vice versa

SYNOPSIS
       @load "ordchr"

       number = ord("A")
       string = chr(65)

DESCRIPTION
       The ordchr extension adds two functions named ord().  and chr(), as follows.

       ord()  This function takes a string argument, and returns the numeric value of the first character in the string.

       chr()  This function takes a numeric argument and returns a string whose first character is that represented by the number.

       These functions are inspired by the Pascal language functions of the same name.

EXAMPLE
       @load "ordchr"
       ...
       printf("The numeric value of 'A' is %d\n", ord("A"))
       printf("The string value of 65 is %s\n", chr(65))
