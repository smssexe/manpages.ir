NAME
       sepermit.conf - configuration file for the pam_sepermit module

DESCRIPTION
       The lines of the configuration file have the following syntax:

       <user>[:<option>:<option>...]

       The user can be specified in the following manner:

       •   a username

       •   a groupname, with @group syntax. This should not be confused with netgroups.

       •   a SELinux user name with %seuser syntax.

       The recognized options are:

       exclusive
	   Only single login session will be allowed for the user and the user's processes will be killed on logout.

       ignore
	   The module will never return PAM_SUCCESS status for the user. It will return PAM_IGNORE if SELinux is in the enforcing mode, and PAM_AUTH_ERR
	   otherwise. It is useful if you want to support passwordless guest users and other confined users with passwords simultaneously.

       The lines which start with # character are comments and are ignored.

EXAMPLES
       These are some example lines which might be specified in /etc/security/sepermit.conf.

	   %guest_u:exclusive
	   %staff_u:ignore
	   %user_u:ignore
