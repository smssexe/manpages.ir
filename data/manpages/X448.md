NAME
       X25519, X448 - EVP_PKEY X25519 and X448 support

DESCRIPTION
       The X25519 and X448 EVP_PKEY implementation supports key generation and key derivation using X25519 and X448. It has associated private and public key
       formats compatible with RFC 8410.

       No additional parameters can be set during key generation.

       The peer public key must be set using EVP_PKEY_derive_set_peer() when performing key derivation.

NOTES
       A context for the X25519 algorithm can be obtained by calling:

	EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_X25519, NULL);

       For the X448 algorithm a context can be obtained by calling:

	EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_X448, NULL);

       X25519 or X448 private keys can be set directly using EVP_PKEY_new_raw_private_key(3) or loaded from a PKCS#8 private key file using
       PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey(3) (or similar function). Completely new keys can also be generated (see the example below). Setting a private key also sets
       the associated public key.

       X25519 or X448 public keys can be set directly using EVP_PKEY_new_raw_public_key(3) or loaded from a SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure in a PEM file using
       PEM_read_bio_PUBKEY(3) (or similar function).

EXAMPLES
       This example generates an X25519 private key and writes it to standard output in PEM format:

	#include <openssl/evp.h>
	#include <openssl/pem.h>
	...
	EVP_PKEY *pkey = NULL;
	EVP_PKEY_CTX *pctx = EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id(EVP_PKEY_X25519, NULL);
	EVP_PKEY_keygen_init(pctx);
	EVP_PKEY_keygen(pctx, &pkey);
	EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(pctx);
	PEM_write_PrivateKey(stdout, pkey, NULL, NULL, 0, NULL, NULL);

       The key derivation example in EVP_PKEY_derive(3) can be used with X25519 and X448.
