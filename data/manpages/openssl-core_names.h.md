NAME
       openssl/core_names.h - OpenSSL provider parameter names

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/core_names.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <openssl/core_names.h> header defines a multitude of macros for OSSL_PARAM(3) names, algorithm names and other known names used with OpenSSL's
       providers, made available for practical purposes only.

       Existing names are further described in the manuals for OpenSSL's providers (see "SEE ALSO") and the manuals for each algorithm they provide (listed in
       those provider manuals).

SEE ALSO
       OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7), OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS(7), OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy(7)

HISTORY
       The macros described here were added in OpenSSL 3.0.

CAVEATS
       This header file does not constitute a general registry of names.  Providers that implement new algorithms are to be responsible for their own
       parameter names.

       However, authors of provider that implement their own variants of algorithms that OpenSSL providers support will want to pay attention to the names
       provided in this header to work in a compatible manner.
