NAME
       modules.dep, modules.dep.bin - Module dependency information

SYNOPSIS
       /lib/modules/modules.dep

       /lib/modules/modules.dep.bin

DESCRIPTION
       modules.dep.bin is a binary file generated by depmod listing the dependencies for every module in the directories under /lib/modules/version. It is
       used by kmod tools such as modprobe and libkmod.

       Its text counterpart is located in the same directory with the name modules.dep. The text version is maintained only for easy of reading by humans and
       is in no way used by any kmod tool.

       These files are not intended for editing or use by any additional utilities as their format is subject to change in the future. You should use the
       modinfo(8) command to obtain information about modules in a future proof and compatible fashion rather than touching these files.
