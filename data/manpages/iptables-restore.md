NAME
       iptables-restore — Restore IP Tables

       ip6tables-restore — Restore IPv6 Tables

SYNOPSIS
       iptables-restore [-chntvV] [-w seconds] [-M modprobe] [-T name] [file]

       ip6tables-restore [-chntvV] [-w seconds] [-M modprobe] [-T name] [file]

DESCRIPTION
       iptables-restore	 and ip6tables-restore are used to restore IP and IPv6 Tables from data specified on STDIN or in file. Use I/O redirection provided by
       your shell to read from a file or specify file as an argument.

       -c, --counters
	      Restore the values of all packet and byte counters.

       -h, --help
	      Print a short option summary.

       -n, --noflush
	      Don't flush the previous contents of the table. If not specified, both commands flush (delete) all previous contents of the respective table.

       -t, --test
	      Only parse and construct the ruleset, but do not commit it.

       -v, --verbose
	      Print additional debug info during ruleset processing.  Specify multiple times to increase debug level.

       -V, --version
	      Print the program version number.

       -w, --wait [seconds]
	      Wait for the xtables lock.  To prevent multiple instances of the program from running concurrently, an attempt will be made to obtain an	exclu‐
	      sive lock at launch.  By default, the program will exit if the lock cannot be obtained.  This option will make the program wait (indefinitely or
	      for optional seconds) until the exclusive lock can be obtained.

       -M, --modprobe modprobe
	      Specify  the  path to the modprobe(8) program. By default, iptables-restore will inspect /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe to determine the executable's
	      path.

       -T, --table name
	      Restore only the named table even if the input stream contains other ones.
