NAME
       revoutput - Reverse output strings sample extension

SYNOPSIS
       @load "revoutput"

       BEGIN { REVOUT = 1 }    # Reverse all output strings

DESCRIPTION
       The  revoutput  extension  adds a simple output wrapper that reverses the characters in each output line.  It's main purpose is to show how to write an
       output wrapper, although it may be mildly amusing for the unwary.

EXAMPLE
       @load "revoutput"

       BEGIN {
	   REVOUT = 1
	   print "hello, world" > "/dev/stdout"
       }

       The output from this program is:

       dlrow ,olleh

BUGS
       This extension does not affect the default standard output.
