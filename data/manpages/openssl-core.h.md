NAME
       openssl/core.h - OpenSSL Core types

SYNOPSIS
	#include <openssl/core.h>

DESCRIPTION
       The <openssl/core.h> header defines a number of public types that are used to communicate between the OpenSSL libraries and implementation providers.
       These types are designed to minimise the need for intimate knowledge of internal structures between the OpenSSL libraries and the providers.

       The types are:

       OSSL_DISPATCH(3)
       OSSL_ITEM(3)
       OSSL_ALGORITHM(3)
       OSSL_PARAM(3)
       OSSL_CALLBACK(3)
       OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK(3)

SEE ALSO
       openssl-core_dispatch.h(7)

HISTORY
       The types described here were added in OpenSSL 3.0.
