PAM_TTY_AUDIT(8)						       Linux-PAM Manual							      PAM_TTY_AUDIT(8)

NAME
       pam_tty_audit - Enable or disable TTY auditing for specified users

SYNOPSIS

       pam_tty_audit.so [disable=patterns] [enable=patterns]

DESCRIPTION
       The pam_tty_audit PAM module is used to enable or disable TTY auditing. By default, the kernel does not audit input on any TTY.

OPTIONS
       disable=patterns
	   For each user matching patterns, disable TTY auditing. This overrides any previous enable option matching the same user name on the command line.
	   See NOTES for further description of patterns.

       enable=patterns
	   For each user matching patterns, enable TTY auditing. This overrides any previous disable option matching the same user name on the command line.
	   See NOTES for further description of patterns.

       open_only
	   Set the TTY audit flag when opening the session, but do not restore it when closing the session. Using this option is necessary for some services
	   that don't fork() to run the authenticated session, such as sudo.

       log_passwd
	   Log keystrokes when ECHO mode is off but ICANON mode is active. This is the mode in which the tty is placed during password entry. By default,
	   passwords are not logged. This option may not be available on older kernels (3.9?).

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
       Only the session type is supported.

RETURN VALUES
       PAM_SESSION_ERR
	   Error reading or modifying the TTY audit flag. See the system log for more details.

       PAM_SUCCESS
	   Success.

NOTES
       When TTY auditing is enabled, it is inherited by all processes started by that user. In particular, daemons restarted by a user will still have TTY
       auditing enabled, and audit TTY input even by other users unless auditing for these users is explicitly disabled. Therefore, it is recommended to use
       disable=* as the first option for most daemons using PAM.

       To view the data that was logged by the kernel to audit use the command aureport --tty.

       The patterns are comma separated lists of glob patterns or ranges of uids. A range is specified as min_uid:max_uid where one of these values can be
       empty. If min_uid is empty only user with the uid max_uid will be matched. If max_uid is empty users with the uid greater than or equal to min_uid will
       be matched.

       Please note that passwords in some circumstances may be logged by TTY auditing even if the log_passwd is not used. For example, all input to an ssh
       session will be logged - even if there is a password being typed into some software running at the remote host because only the local TTY state affects
       the local TTY auditing.

EXAMPLES
       Audit all administrative actions.
