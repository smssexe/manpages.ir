pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(3)				   Library Functions Manual				      pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(3)

NAME
       pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np, pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np - push and pop thread cancelation clean-up handlers while saving cancelability type

LIBRARY
       POSIX threads library (libpthread, -lpthread)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <pthread.h>

       void pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(void (*routine)(void *), void *arg);
       void pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np(int execute);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(), pthread_cleanup_pop_defer_np():
	   _GNU_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       These functions are the same as pthread_cleanup_push(3) and pthread_cleanup_pop(3), except for the differences noted on this page.

       Like pthread_cleanup_push(3), pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np() pushes routine onto the thread's stack of cancelation clean-up handlers.  In addition, it
       also  saves  the	 thread's  current cancelability type, and sets the cancelability type to "deferred" (see pthread_setcanceltype(3)); this ensures that
       cancelation clean-up will occur even if the thread's cancelability type was "asynchronous" before the call.

       Like pthread_cleanup_pop(3), pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np() pops the top-most clean-up handler from the thread's stack of cancelation	clean-up  han‚Äê
       dlers.  In addition, it restores the thread's cancelability type to its value at the time of the matching pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np().

       The  caller  must  ensure that calls to these functions are paired within the same function, and at the same lexical nesting level.  Other restrictions
       apply, as described in pthread_cleanup_push(3).

       This sequence of calls:

	   pthread_cleanup_push_defer_np(routine, arg);
	   pthread_cleanup_pop_restore_np(execute);

       is equivalent to (but shorter and more efficient than):

	   int oldtype;

	   pthread_cleanup_push(routine, arg);
	   pthread_setcanceltype(PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, &oldtype);
	   ...
	   pthread_setcanceltype(oldtype, NULL);
	   pthread_cleanup_pop(execute);

STANDARDS
       GNU; hence the suffix "_np" (nonportable) in the names.

HISTORY
