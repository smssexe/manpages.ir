NAME
       projects - persistent project root definition

DESCRIPTION
       The  /etc/projects file provides a mapping between numeric project identifiers and those directories which are the roots of the quota tree.  Its format
       is simply:

	    # comments are hash-prefixed
	    # ...
	    10:/export/cage
	    42:/var/log

       The /etc/projects file is optional, instead xfs_quota(8) can be used with the -p argument to specify a project root directly for each operation.

SEE ALSO
       xfs_quota(8), xfsctl(3), projid(5).
