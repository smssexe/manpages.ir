NAME
       ed - line-oriented text editor

SYNOPSIS
       ed [options] [[+line] file]

DESCRIPTION
       GNU  ed	is  a  line-oriented  text editor. It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via shell
       scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in the current directory and cannot execute shell commands. Ed is the 'standard' text ed‐
       itor in the sense that it is the original editor for Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however, it is superseded by full-screen  edi‐
       tors such as GNU Emacs or GNU Moe.

       The  file name may be preceded by '+line', '+/RE', or '+?RE' to set the current line to the line number specified or to the first or last line matching
       the regular expression 'RE'.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
	      display this help and exit

       -V, --version

       -E, --extended-regexp

       -G, --traditional

       -l, --loose-exit-status
	      exit with 0 status even if a command fails

       -p, --prompt=STRING
	      use STRING as an interactive prompt

       -q, --quiet, --silent
	      suppress diagnostics written to stderr

       -r, --restricted
	      run in restricted mode

       -s, --script
	      suppress byte counts and '!' prompt

       -v, --verbose
	      be verbose; equivalent to the 'H' command

       --strip-trailing-cr

       --unsafe-names

       Start edit by reading in 'file' if given.  If 'file' begins with a '!', read output of shell command.

       Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (invalid command-line options, memory exhausted, command failed, etc),  2	 for  problems
       with the input file (file not found, buffer modified, I/O errors), 3 for an internal consistency error (e.g., bug) which caused ed to panic.
