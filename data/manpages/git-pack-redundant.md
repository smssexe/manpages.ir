NAME
       git-pack-redundant - Find redundant pack files

SYNOPSIS
       git pack-redundant [--verbose] [--alt-odb] (--all | <pack-filename>...)

WARNING
       git pack-redundant has been deprecated and is scheduled for removal in a future version of Git. Because it can only remove entire duplicate packs and
       not individual duplicate objects, it is generally not a useful tool for reducing repository size. You are better off using git gc to do so, which will
       put objects into a new pack, removing duplicates.

       Running pack-redundant without the --i-still-use-this flag will fail in this release. If you believe you have a use case for which pack-redundant is
       better suited and oppose this removal, please contact the Git mailing list at git@vger.kernel.org[1]. More information about the list is available at
       https://git-scm.com/community.

DESCRIPTION
       This program computes which packs in your repository are redundant. The output is suitable for piping to xargs rm if you are in the root of the
       repository.

       git pack-redundant accepts a list of objects on standard input. Any objects given will be ignored when checking which packs are required. This makes
       the following command useful when wanting to remove packs which contain unreachable objects.

       git fsck --full --unreachable | cut -d ' ' -f3 | \ git pack-redundant --all | xargs rm

OPTIONS
       --all
	   Processes all packs. Any filenames on the command line are ignored.

       --alt-odb
	   Don’t require objects present in packs from alternate object database (odb) directories to be present in local packs.

       --verbose
	   Outputs some statistics to stderr. Has a small performance penalty.
