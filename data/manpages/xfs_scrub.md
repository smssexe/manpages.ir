NAME
       xfs_scrub - check and repair the contents of a mounted XFS filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       xfs_scrub [ -abCemnTvx ] mount-point
       xfs_scrub -V

DESCRIPTION
       xfs_scrub attempts to check and repair all metadata in a mounted XFS filesystem.

       WARNING!	 This program is EXPERIMENTAL, which means that its behavior and interface could change at any time!

       xfs_scrub asks the kernel to scrub all metadata objects in the filesystem.  Metadata records are scanned for obviously bad values and then cross-refer‐
       enced  against  other metadata.	The goal is to establish a reasonable confidence about the consistency of the overall filesystem by examining the con‐
       sistency of individual metadata records against the other metadata in the filesystem.  Damaged metadata can be rebuilt from other metadata if there ex‐
       ists redundant data structures which are intact.

       Filesystem corruption and optimization opportunities will be logged to the standard error stream.  Enabling verbose mode will increase  the  amount  of
       status information sent to the output.

       If  the	kernel scrub reports that metadata needs repairs or optimizations and the user does not pass -n on the command line, this program will ask the
       kernel to make the repairs and to perform the optimizations.  See the sections about optimizations and repairs for a list of optimizations and  repairs
       known  to  this program.	 The kernel may not support repairing or optimizing the filesystem.  If this is the case, the filesystem must be unmounted and
       xfs_repair(8) run on the filesystem to fix the problems.

OPTIONS
       -a errors
	      Abort if more than this many errors are found on the filesystem.

       -b     Run in background mode.  If the option is specified once, only run a single scrubbing thread at a time.  If given more than once, an  artificial
	      delay of 100us is added to each scrub call to reduce CPU overhead even further.

       -C fd  This option causes xfs_scrub to write progress information to the specified file description so that the progress of the filesystem check can be
	      monitored.   If  the  file  description is a tty, a fancy progress bar is rendered.  Otherwise, a simple numeric status dump compatible with the
	      fsck -C format is output.

       -e     Specifies what happens when errors are detected.	If shutdown is given, the filesystem will be taken offline if errors are found.	  If  continue
	      is given, no action is taken if errors are found; this is the default behavior.

       -k     Do not call TRIM on the free space.

       -m file
	      Search this file for mounted filesystems instead of /etc/mtab.

       -n     Only check filesystem metadata.  Do not repair or optimize anything.

       -T     Print timing and memory usage information for each phase.

       -v     Enable verbose mode, which prints periodic status updates.

       -V     Prints the version number and exits.

       -x     Read all file data extents to look for disk errors.  xfs_scrub will issue O_DIRECT reads to the block device directly.  If the block device is a
	      SCSI  disk,  it will instead issue READ VERIFY commands directly to the disk.  If media errors are found, the error report will include the disk
	      offset, in bytes.	 If the media errors affect a file, the report will also include the inode number and file offset, in  bytes.	These  actions
	      will confirm that all file data blocks can be read from storage.

OPTIMIZATIONS
       Optimizations supported by this program include, but are not limited to:

       • Instructing the underlying storage to discard unused extents via the TRIM ioctl.

       • Updating secondary superblocks to match the primary superblock.

       • Turning off shared block write checks for files that no longer share blocks.

REPAIRS
       Repairs are performed by calling into the kernel.  This limits the scope of repair activities to rebuilding primary data structures from secondary data
       structures,  or	secondary structures from primary structures.  The existence of secondary data structures may require features that can only be turned
       on from mkfs.xfs(8).  If errors cannot be repaired, the filesystem must be unmounted and xfs_repair(8) run.  Repairs supported by the  kernel  include,
       but are not limited to:

       • Reconstructing extent allocation data.

       • Rebuilding free space information.

       • Rebuilding inode indexes.

       • Fixing minor corruptions of inode records.

       • Recalculating reference count information.

       • Reconstructing reverse mapping data from primary extent allocation data.

       • Scheduling a quotacheck for the next mount.

       If corrupt metadata is successfully repaired, this program will log that a repair has succeeded instead of a corruption report.

EXIT CODE
       The exit code returned by xfs_scrub is the sum of the following conditions:
	    0	 - No errors
	    1	 - File system errors left uncorrected
	    2	 - File system optimizations possible
	    4	 - Operational error
	    8	 - Usage or syntax error

CAVEATS
       xfs_scrub  is  an immature utility!  Do not run this program unless you have backups of your data!  This program takes advantage of in-kernel scrubbing
       to verify a given data structure with locks held and can keep the filesystem busy for a long time.  The kernel  must  be	 new  enough  to  support  the
       SCRUB_METADATA ioctl.

       If errors are found and cannot be repaired, the filesystem must be unmounted and repaired.
